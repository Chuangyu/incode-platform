This module, intended for use with http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis], provides a wrapper around Freemarker
templating engine.


== How to configure/use

You can either use this module "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements. 

=== "Out-of-the-box"

To use "out-of-the-box":

* update your classpath by adding this dependency in your dom project's `pom.xml`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.isisaddons.module.freemarker</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-module-freemarker-dom</artifactId>
    <version>1.13.1</version>
</dependency>
----

* update the `getModules()` method of your `AppManifest`: +
+
[source,java]
----
@Override
public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
    return Arrays.asList(
            ...
            org.isisaddons.module.freemarker.dom.FreeMarkerModule.class,
            ...
    );
}
----


=== "Out-of-the-box" (-SNAPSHOT)

If you want to use the current `-SNAPSHOT`, then the steps are the same as above, except:

* when updating the classpath, specify the appropriate -SNAPSHOT version: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<version>1.14.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
----

* add the repository definition to pick up the most recent snapshot (we use the Cloudbees continuous integration service). We suggest defining the repository in a `<profile>`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>cloudbees-snapshots</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo</id>
            <url>http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</profile>
----


=== Forking the repo

If instead you want to extend this module's functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo. The repo is
structured as follows:

* `pom.xml` - parent pom
* `dom` - the module implementation, depends on Isis applib




== API

In order to understand the API of the service provided by this module (`FreeMarkService`), it's necessary to
understand a little of the API/SPI exposed by FreeMarker itself.

=== FreeMarker's Design

Freemarker's design is that templates are identified by a template name and a version.  Freemarker's `TemplateLoader`
SPI is used to lookup the template text and to check whether that template text is stale; Freemarker automatically
caches any template text and only reads in new text if a "lastModified" property has changed.  The sequence is:

* calls `TemplateLoader#findTemplateSource(templateName) +
+
to look up an object that can act as the source of the template text (can return a reader).  For example, this
templateName might just be a file name.

* then calls `TemplateLoader#getLastModified(templateSource)` +
+
to determine the time (ie versoin) of this particular source.  For example, if the template source is a file, then this
would be the lastModified timestamp on this file.

* if necessary, then calls `TemplateLoader#getReader(templateSource, encoding)`. +
+
Freemarker automatically caches template text, so it will only make this call if the templateSource returns a newer
lastModified timestamp than cached.

When FreeMarker passes in the templateName to `#findTemplateSource(.)` it also appends a locale, eg "_en_GB".  The idea,
obviously, is that locale-specific versions of templates can be returned.


=== FreeMarkerService

This module provides a single service, called `FreeMarkerService`.  It has the following API:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class FreeMarkerService {
    public String render(
            String templateName,                        // <1>
            long version,                               // <2>
            String templateChars,                       // <3>
            Object dataModel)                           // <4>
        throws IOException, TemplateException;
}
----
<1> the name/version of the template, corresponding directly to FreeMarker's "templateName".
<3> the `templateChars` is the actual template text itself
<4> the `dataModel` is the object whose values are interpolated by Freemarker into the template.  This can either be
a strongly typed DTO or just a simple `Map`.


This method takes parameters that (from FreeMarker's point of view) represent both the input to finding a template
and also the output (the text of that template):

* the `templateName` broadly corresponds directly to FreeMarker's "templateName". +
+
To support multiple versions of a template over time, just create a composite name.  Similarly, if multiple versions
of a template are needed for different app tenancies, combine that into the composite name also. +
+
For example, to support two versions of an "InvoiceTemplate" for France and for Italy, each published on 1 Dec 2015,
one could pass in a template of "Invoice:/FRA:2015-12-01" or "Invoice:/ITA:2015-12-01".

* the `templateChars` is the template text that is used to return a StringReader if and when FreeMarker calls
`#getReader(...)`.

Internally FreeMarker caches the template characters; it uses the `templateName` and the `version` as a way to
determine whether its internal cache is invalid.  As a small wrinkle, it also performs the caching on a per-locale
basis; the `templateName` used internally will have a locale appended to it (eg "_en_GB").

All this caching is irrelevant to the `FreeMarkerService`, because it passes in the template characters irrespective; these
are simply made available on a thread-local.  The responsibility for caching therefore moves outside of FreeMarker,
and to the calling application.  Thus, the intended usage is that the template characters will be stored in an entity
(let's call it `DocumentTemplate`, say) which could be identified by `documentType` and `atPath`, say, and which also
is versioned.  The `documentType` and `atPath` can simply be joined together to create the logical template name.

[NOTE]
====
FreeMarker also supports the notion of versioned templates (the `TemplateSourc#getLastModified()` API), however
there's clearly a subtlety going on somewhere because in an earlier design of this service (which took in a `version`
parameter for the template) it didn't seem to work.  Since in most cases the templateName is likely to be a composite
anyway (for application tenancy), the decision is simply to also include the version number as well in this
"template name".
====



== Example Usage

From the unit tests:

[source,java]
----
// given
 Map<String, String> properties = ImmutableMap.of("user", "John Doe");

// when
String merged = service.render("WelcomeUserTemplate:/GBR:2015-12-01:", "<h1>Welcome ${user}!</h1>",  properties);

// then
assertThat(merged, is("<h1>Welcome John Doe!</h1>"));
----

== Maven deploy notes

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

=== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd dom
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].

=== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.14.0 \
              1.15.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where

* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master
git push origin 1.14.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again. Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo). You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
