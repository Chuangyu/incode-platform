This module, intended for use with link:http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis], defines ``CommunicationChannel``s (email address, postal address or phone/fax number), and also allows ``Document``s (implemented by the Incode http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-document[Document] module) to be sent as ``Communication``s either to an email address or to a postal address.

A `Document` is an entity that holds some sort of content, either binary such as PDF or Word document or text such as HTML; they can be rendered in various ways.
``Document``s can be attached to arbitrary domain objects using ``Paperclip``s.

A `Communication` is an entity that is a record of sending a `Document` to some party by way of their `CommunicationChannel`; these are the "correspondents" of the `Communication`.
A `Communication` can be created either by sending the `Document` by email (ie to an email address), or by post (ie to a postal address).
The module does not currently provided any capability to "send" a `Document` by phone or by fax.

Email ``Communication``s always have an HTML cover note `Document` generated and associated with the `Communication`; the original `Document` is also associated.
This cover note is used as the body of the actual email, while the original `Document` is included as an email attachment.
If the original `Document` had supporting ``Document``s associated with it (eg a tax or supplier receipt for an invoice), then these supporting documents are also included as attachments.

Postal ``Communication``s do _not_ have any sort of cover note, and the act of sending them is manual: the end-user downloads the original `Document` "through" the `Communication`; this marks the `Communication` as having been sent.
If the original `Document` had supporting ``Document``s associated with it then (as a convenience) a single PDF is downloaded that merges together the original `Document` along with any supporting documents.


[NOTE]
====
There is some overlap between this module and the Incode http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel[CommunicationChannel] module).
At some stage we intend to refactor this module to reuse the CommunicationChannel module, and then to remove any duplicate concepts (`EmailAddress` etc).
====




== Screenshots

We start off by creating some fixture data:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/010-run-fixture-script.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/010-run-fixture-script.png"]

This creates:

* demo customers, with a variety of ``CommunicationChannel``s.

* demo invoices, each of which has a `Document` that has an associated document (simulating it having been generated already).
Each invoice is also associated with ("owned" by) a customer

* prerequisite reference data to generate email cover notes:

** A `DocumentType` for the email cover notes. +
+
This is referenced by the demo app's implementation of the `DocumentCommunicationSupport` SPI service

** A corresponding `DocumentTemplate` for email cover notes

** The Freemarker rendering strategy (from the link:https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-docrendering-freemarker[Incode Freemarker DocRendering] module).
This is referenced by the `DocumentTemplate`, instructing the document module to render the email cover note using freemarker.

* `Country` ref data (from the link:https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-country[Incode Country] module). +
+
This is required because `PostalAddress` communication channels reference the `Country`.

The home page lists the demo customers and invoices:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/020-demo-customers-and-invoices.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/020-demo-customers-and-invoices.png"]


=== Sending an Email

If we inspect one of the invoices for "Fred" (who has email addresses), we see it has an attached `Document` (simulating it having been generated from the invoice):

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/030-demo-invoice-for-customer-with-email-addresses.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/030-demo-invoice-for-customer-with-email-addresses.png"]

If we inspect that `Document` in turn, we can see that the "send by email" action is enabled:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/040-document-to-sendByEmail.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/040-document-to-sendByEmail.png"]

This is because the demo app's implementation of the `DocumentCommunicationSupport` SPI service was able to figure out an email address to use (the document's invoice's customer).

The "sendByEmail" action prompt shows these emails:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/050-sendByEmail-prompt.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/050-sendByEmail-prompt.png"]

Invoking the action results in an email `Communication`:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/052-sendByEmail-result.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/052-sendByEmail-result.png"]

When an email `Communication` is created, it also automatically create a cover note `Document.
The cover note is used as the body of the email, while the original `Document` is sent as an attachment.
The cover note `Document` is automatically associated with the `Communication`, shown by the "coverNoteFor" property:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/054-cover-note-generated.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/054-cover-note-generated.png"]

The generated cover note is required to be HTML (so that it can be used as the body of the email).
In the case of the demo app this cover note is generated using Freemarker:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/055-cover-note-text.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/055-cover-note-text.png"]

The generated `Communication` is also associated with the original `Document`:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/056-document-associated-with-communication.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/056-document-associated-with-communication.png"]

Looking again at the generated email `Communication`, we see that it is scheduled to be sent in the background command:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/060-communication-sent-in-background.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/060-communication-sent-in-background.png"]

The demo app has not been configured with a background scheduler, but does provide a "fake" scheduler which can be used to run such commands:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/062-fake-scheduler.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/062-fake-scheduler.png"]

Which results in the email being sent:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/064-email-sent.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/064-email-sent.png"]

In fact, the demo app is not configured with a real email service either; instead it has a fake service that allows "sent" email messages to be inspected:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/066-list-sent-emails.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/066-list-sent-emails.png"]

The sent email has the correct body, and one attachment (the original `Document`):

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/068-view-sent-email.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/068-view-sent-email.png"]



=== Sending a Postal Communication

The "Mary" demo customer has postal addresses, so the ``Document``s attached to her invoices can be sent by post.

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/070-sendByPost-prompt.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/070-sendByPost-prompt.png"]

As for email, this also results in a `Communication`:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/072-sendByPost-result.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/072-sendByPost-result.png"]

What's different here is that there is no cover note,  there is no "prepared by" correspondent, and there is no background command.

Instead, the object provides the "download PDF for posting" action:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/080-downloadPdfForPosting-prompt.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/080-downloadPdfForPosting-prompt.png"]


The idea is that (through the `Communication`) the user just downloads the original (PDF) `Document` that it references; the act of doing this marks the `Communication` as sent:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/082-downloadPdfForPosting-result.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/082-downloadPdfForPosting-result.png"]

The user can then open up the downloaded PDF, manually print it and manually put it into an envelope.


=== Supporting Documents

The link:https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-document[Incode Document] module (on which this communications module) depends has the concept of "supporting" documents.
For example, a generated `Document` of an invoice might have associated tax or supplier receipts which have been previously scanned in and which are available as PDFs.

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/090-attachSupportingPdf-prompt.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/090-attachSupportingPdf-prompt.png"]

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/092-attachSupportingPdf-result.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/092-attachSupportingPdf-result.png"]

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/100-sendByEmail-prompt.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/100-sendByEmail-prompt.png"]

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/102-sendByEmail-result.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/102-sendByEmail-result.png"]

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/104-sent-email.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/104-sent-email.png"]

It is also possible to send a postal communication with supporting documents:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/110-sendByPost-prompt.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/110-sendByPost-prompt.png"]


The only difference is that, when the ``Document``s are downloaded for printing via the `Communication`, for convenience the PDFs will be stitched together into a single PDF for printing.
The action prompt suggests a filename based on the original `Document` and supporting ``Document``s.

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/120-downloadPdfForPosting-prompt.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/master/images/120-downloadPdfForPosting-prompt.png"]


== Domain Model

[***TODO***]




== Services


=== API

[***TODO***]


=== SPI Services

==== DocumentCommunicationSupport

An implementation of the `DocumentCommunicationSupport` SPI domain service is required to send communications of any type.
Its signature is:

[source,java]
----
public interface DocumentCommunicationSupport {
    DocumentType emailCoverNoteDocumentTypeFor(Document document);
    void inferEmailHeaderFor(Document document, CommHeaderForEmail header);
    void inferPrintHeaderFor(Document document, CommHeaderForPrint header);
}
----

==== CurrentUserEmailAddressProvider

The optional `CurrentUserEmailAddressProvider` SPI service provides the email address of the current user, in order to create a `CommChannelRole` indicating that the `Communication` was "prepared by" such-and-such a user.

Its signature is:

[source,java]
----
public interface CurrentUserEmailAddressProvider {
    String currentUserEmailAddress();
----

The module does provide a default implementation, `CurrentUserEmailAddressProvider.UsingMeService`, that uses the `MeService` of the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[Isis addons' security] module.
In many case therefore there will be no need to provide an alternative implementation of this SPI service.


== How to run the Demo App


The prerequisite software is:

* Java JDK 8
* http://maven.apache.org[maven 3] (3.2.x or later is recommended).

To build the demo app:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/incodehq/isis-module-communications.git
cd isis-module-communications
mvn clean install
----


To run the demo app:

[source]
----
mvn -pl webapp -Dmavenmixin-jettywar jetty:run
----

Then log on using user: `sven`, password: `pass`



== How to configure/use

You can either use this module "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements. 

=== "Out-of-the-box"

To use "out-of-the-box":

* update your classpath by adding this dependency in your dom project's `pom.xml`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.incode.module.communications</groupId>
    <artifactId>incode-module-communications-dom</artifactId>
    <version>1.14.1</version>
</dependency>
----

* in the `AppManifest`, update its `getModules()` method: +
+
[source,java]
----
@Override
public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
    return Arrays.asList(
            ...
            org.incode.module.communications.dom.CommunicationsModule.class,
    );
}
----



Notes:

* Check for later releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|incode-module-communications-dom[Maven Central Repo].


==== "Out-of-the-box" (-SNAPSHOT)

If you want to use the current `-SNAPSHOT`, then the steps are the same as above, except:

* when updating the classpath, specify the appropriate -SNAPSHOT version:

[source,xml]
----
<version>1.15.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
----

* add the repository definition to pick up the most recent snapshot (we use the Cloudbees continuous integration service).  
We suggest defining the repository in a `<profile>`:

[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>cloudbees-snapshots</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo</id>
            <url>http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false>/enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</profile>
----





== Known issues

(none)


== Change Log


* `1.14.1` - fixes https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/issues/1[#1], https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/issues/2[#2], https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/issues/3[#3], https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/issues/4[#4], https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/issues/5[#5], https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-communications/issues/6[#6] and uses link:https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-document[document] module 1.14.2
* `1.14.0` - released against Isis 1.14.0
* `1.13.0` - released against Isis 1.13.2, extracted from Estatio codebase



== Forking the repo

If instead you want to extend this module's functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo.  The repo is
structured as follows:

* `pom.xml` - parent pom
* `module-dom` - the module implementation itself
* `demo/module-dom` - demo app's supporting domain that uses `module-dom` in some way
* `demo/application` - demo app's app manifest and application-level integration tets
* `demo/webapp` - demo app's webapp, to create war and docker images


Only the `module-dom` project is released to Maven Central Repo.  The versions of the other modules are purposely left at
`0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` because they are not intended to be released.


Note that the module uses link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok].  To compile the code within your IDE you will
therefore require the appropriate Lombok plugin.  See the link:https://projectlombok.org/download.html[Lombok download page] for more information.

=== Dependencies

None.


=== Icons

The icons are provided by https://icons8.com/[Icons8].


==  Maven deploy notes

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

=== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd dom
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].



=== Release an Interim Build

If you have commit access to this project (or a fork of your own) then you can create interim releases using the `interim-release.sh` script.

The idea is that this will - in a new branch - update the `dom/pom.xml` with a timestamped version (eg `1.14.1.20170331-0740`).
It then pushes the branch (and a tag) to the specified remote.

A CI server such as Jenkins can monitor the branches matching the wildcard `origin/interim/*` and create a build.
These artifacts can then be published to a snapshot repository.

For example:

[source]
----
sh interim-release.sh 1.14.1 origin
----

where

* `1.14.1` is the base release
* `origin` is the name of the remote to which you have permissions to write to.




=== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.14.1 \
              1.15.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master && git push origin 1.14.1
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue before trying again.
Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the `autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo).
You may want to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
