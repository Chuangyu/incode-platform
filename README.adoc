This module, intended for use with http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis], provides a wrapper around link:https://pdfbox.apache.org[Apache PDFBox].



== How to configure/use

You can either use this module "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements. 

To use "out-of-the-box":

* update your classpath by adding this dependency in your dom project's `pom.xml`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.isisaddons.module.pdfbox</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-module-pdfbox-dom</artifactId>
    <version>1.14.0</version>
</dependency>
----

* update the `getModules()` method of your `AppManifest`: +
+
[source,java]
----
@Override
public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
    return Arrays.asList(
            ...
            org.isisaddons.module.pdfbox.dom.PdfBoxModule.class,
            ...
    );
}
----



=== Supporting encrypted PDFs

Encrypted PDFs can be handled by adding the optional link:http://www.bouncycastle.org/[Legion of the Bouncy Castle] encryption libraries.
These can be included in your Maven project using three or so dependencies.
At the time of writing these were:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
    <artifactId>bcprov-jdk15on</artifactId>
    <version>1.54</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
    <artifactId>bcmail-jdk15on</artifactId>
    <version>1.54</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.bouncycastle</groupId>
    <artifactId>bcpkix-jdk15on</artifactId>
    <version>1.54</version>
</dependency>
----



See the link:https://pdfbox.apache.org/2.0/dependencies.html[PDFBox documentation] for the most up-to-date information.



== API

This module provides a single service, called `PdfBoxService`.
It has the following API:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class PdfBoxService {

    public byte[] merge(byte[]... pdfByteArrays) throws IOException { }     // <1>

    public void merge(                                                      // <2>
            OutputStream outputStream,
            InputStream... inputStreams
        ) throws IOException { }
}
----
<1> merge an arbitrary number of PDFs, represented as arrays of bytes, to another byte array
<2> merge an arbitrary number of PDFs, represented as an input stream, to an output stream

=== Dependencies

link:https://pdfbox.apache.org[Apache PDFBox] and optionally link:http://www.bouncycastle.org/[Legion of the Bouncy Castle] to handle encrypted PDFs.



=== Forking the repo

If you want to extend this module's functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo.
The repo is structured as follows:

* `pom.xml` - parent pom
* `dom` - the module implementation, depends on Isis applib





== Maven deploy notes

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

=== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd dom
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].


=== Release an Interim Build

If you have commit access to this project (or a fork of your own) then you can create interim releases using the `interim-release.sh` script.

The idea is that this will - in a new branch - update the `dom/pom.xml` with a timestamped version (eg `1.14.0.20170227-0738`).
It then pushes the branch (and a tag) to the specified remote.

A CI server such as Jenkins can monitor the branches matching the wildcard `origin/interim/*` and create a build.
These artifacts can then be published to a snapshot repository.

For example:

[source]
----
sh interim-release.sh 1.14.0 origin
----

where

* `1.14.0` is the base release
* `origin` is the name of the remote to which you have permissions to write to.



=== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.14.0 \
              1.15.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where

* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master && git push origin 1.14.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again. Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo). You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
