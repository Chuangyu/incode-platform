This module, intended for use with http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis], provides a wrapper around Freemarker
templating engine.


== How to configure/use

You can either use this module "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements. 

=== "Out-of-the-box"

To use "out-of-the-box":

* update your classpath by adding this dependency in your dom project's `pom.xml`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.isisaddons.module.freemarker</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-module-freemarker-dom</artifactId>
    <version>1.13.0</version>
</dependency>
----

* update the `getModules()` method of your `AppManifest`: +
+
[source,java]
----
@Override
public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
    return Arrays.asList(
            ...
            org.isisaddons.module.freemarker.dom.FreeMarkerModule.class,
            ...
    );
}
----


=== "Out-of-the-box" (-SNAPSHOT)

If you want to use the current `-SNAPSHOT`, then the steps are the same as above, except:

* when updating the classpath, specify the appropriate -SNAPSHOT version: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<version>1.14.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
----

* add the repository definition to pick up the most recent snapshot (we use the Cloudbees continuous integration service). We suggest defining the repository in a `<profile>`:

[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>cloudbees-snapshots</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo</id>
            <url>http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</profile>
----


=== Forking the repo

If instead you want to extend this module's functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo. The repo is
structured as follows:

* `pom.xml` - parent pom
* `dom` - the module implementation, depends on Isis applib




== API

In order to understand the API of the service provided by this module (`FreeMarkService`), it's necessary to
understand a little of the API/SPI exposed by FreeMarker itself.

== FreeMarker's Design

Freemarker's design is that templates are identified by a template name and a version.  Freemarker's `TemplateLoader`
SPI is used to lookup the template text and to check whether that template text is stale; Freemarker automatically
caches any template text and only reads in new text if a "lastModified" property has changed.  The sequence is:

* calls `TemplateLoader#findTemplateSource(templateName) +
+
to look up an object that can act as the source of the template text (can return a reader).  For example, this
templateName might just be a file name.

* then calls `TemplateLoader#getLastModified(templateSource)` +
+
to determine the time (ie versoin) of this particular source.  For example, if the template source is a file, then this
would be the lastModified timestamp on this file.

* if necessary, then calls `TemplateLoader#getReader(templateSource, encoding)`. +
+
Freemarker automatically caches template text, so it will only make this call if the templateSource returns a newer
lastModified timestamp than cached.

When FreeMarker passes in the templateName to `#findTemplateSource(.)` it also appends a locale, eg "_en_GB".  The idea,
obviously, is that locale-specific versions of templates can be returned.


=== FreeMarkerService

This module provides a single service, called `FreeMarkerService`.  It has the following API:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class FreeMarkerService {
    public String render(
            String documentType,                        // <1>
            String atPath,
            long version,                               // <2>
            String templateChars,                       // <3>
            Object dataModel)                           // <4>
        throws IOException, TemplateException;
}
----
<1> the `documentType` and `atPath` together correspond to FreeMarker's "templateName".
<2> the `version` tells Freemarker which version of the template is being used
<3> the `templateChars` is the actual template text itself
<4> the `dataModel` is the object whose values are interpolated by Freemarker into the template.  This can either be
a strongly typed DTO or just a simple `Map`.

This method takes parameters that (from FreeMarker's point of view) represent both the input to finding a template
and also the output (the text of that template):

* the `documentType` and `atPath` together correspond to FreeMarker's "templateName". +
+
The `atPath` is the application tenancy path (eg "/" or "/ITA"), as per the
http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[Isis addons' security] module.  The two parameters are concatenated
together (with a `:`); any locale suffix (eg "_en_GB") is ignored.

* the `version` is the value that will be returned to FreeMarker when it calls "#getLastModified(...)".

* the `templateChars` is the template text that is used to return a StringReader if and when FreeMarker calls
`#getReader(...)`.

The intended usage is that the template will be stored in an entity (let's call it `DocumentTemplate`, say) which is
identified by `documentType` and `atPath`, and which also is versioned.  It also, of course, holds the actual template
text.  The `render(...)` method therefore basically accepts the fields of this `DocumentTemplate`, along with the
dataModel DTO/Map which is interpolated into the template.

=== Dependencies

The application uses icons from link:https://icons8.com/[icons8].


== Maven deploy notes

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

=== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd dom
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].

=== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.14.0 \
              1.15.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master
git push origin 1.14.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again. Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo). You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
