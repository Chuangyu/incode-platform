This module, intended for use with link:http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis], provides the ability to attach `Note`
objects to arbitrary domain objects.  Domain objects are required to implement the `Notable` marker interface, and must implement a subclass from the `NotableLink` abstract class (about 90 lines of boilerplate).

Each `Note` implements the `CalendarEventable` interface (from link:http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-fullcalendar2[Fullcalendar2 wicket component]) meaning that they can be rendered in a calendar view.

It also means that each note, when created, belongs to a named calendar (just a string).  The optional `CalendarNameRepository` SPI service is used to enumerate the calendars for any given `Notable` domain object.  If no implementation of this service can be found, then the module allows notes to be added to a single "default" calendar.

Any given `Notable` domain object can have multiple `Note`s.  As currently implemented, a `Note` can only




== Screenshots

The following screenshots show an example app's usage of the module.

We start by installing some demo fixture data:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-note/master/images/010-run-fixture-script.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-note/master/images/010-run-fixture-script.png"]

This installs some very simple domain objects to which we want to attach notes:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-note/master/images/020-list-all.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-note/master/images/020-list-all.png"]

These are our `Notable` domain objects.

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-note/master/images/030-view-domain-object.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-note/master/images/030-view-domain-object.png"]

The fixture sets up some notes for each of these `Notable` objects; these are displayed in a (contributed) `notes` collection.  We can also add new notes using a (contributed) `addNote(...)` action:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-note/master/images/040-add-note.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-note/master/images/040-add-note.png"]

The action allows the note text and optionally a date/calendar to be specified.  Every note must have either text and/or a date and calendar.  Also, each `Notable` can only associate one `Note` per calendar.  The list of calendars is defined by the optional `CalendarNameRepository` SPI domain service, discussed below:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-note/master/images/050-enter-note-details.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-note/master/images/050-enter-note-details.png"]

The notes for the `Notable` domain object is added to.  Each `Note` can also be viewed:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-note/master/images/060-note-added-to-collection.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-note/master/images/060-note-added-to-collection.png"]

The `Note` shows the text and date/calendar, as well as the `Notable` domain object that it is attached to.

The `changeNote(...)` action allows the note text to be updated (or cleared/set to null if the note has a date/calendar):

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-note/master/images/080-change-note-text.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-note/master/images/080-change-note-text.png"]

while the `changeDate(...)` action...

... allows the note's date/calendar to be updated (or cleared/set to null if the note has text):

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-note/master/images/100-change-date-details.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-note/master/images/100-change-date-details.png"]

Each `Note` implements the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-fullcalendar2[Isis addons' fullcalendar2] wicket extension's `CalendarEventable` interface, meaning ...

... that it can be rendered on a calendar:

== How to run the Demo App

The prerequisite software is:

* Java JDK 8
* http://maven.apache.org[maven 3] (3.2.x or later is recommended).

To build the demo app:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/incodehq/isis-module-note.git
mvn clean install
----

To run the demo app:

[source]
----
mvn antrun:run -P self-host
----

Then log on using user: `sven`, password: `pass`


== How to configure/use

You can either use this module "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements. 

=== "Out-of-the-box"

To use "out-of-the-box":

* update your classpath by adding importing the parent module's dependency into in your parent module's `pom.xml`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.incode.module.note</groupId>
            <artifactId>isis-module-note-dom</artifactId>
            <version>${isis-module-note.version}</version>
        </dependency>
        ...
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

* if using `AppManifest`, then update its `getModules()` method:

    @Override
    public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
        return Arrays.asList(
                ...
                org.incode.module.note.dom.NoteModule.class,
        );
    }


* alternatively, in your project's `webapp` module, update your `WEB-INF/isis.properties`. +
+
[source,xml]
----
  isis.services.ServicesInstallerFromAnnotation.packagePrefix=\
                                ...\
                                org.incode.module.note.dom,\
                                ...
----



Notes:

* Check for later releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|isis-module-event-dom[Maven Central Repo]).


==== "Out-of-the-box" (-SNAPSHOT)

If you want to use the current `-SNAPSHOT`, then the steps are the same as above, except:

* when updating the classpath, specify the appropriate -SNAPSHOT version:

[source,xml]
----
<version>1.10.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
----

* add the repository definition to pick up the most recent snapshot (we use the Cloudbees continuous integration service).  We suggest defining the repository in a `<profile>`:

[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>cloudbees-snapshots</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo<;/id>
            <url>http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false>/enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</profile>

=== For each domain object...

... that you want to be able to attach notes, you need to implement the `Notable` marker interface and implement a subsclass of `NotableLink` to hold a type-safe reference back to the domain object.

In return, for each such `Notable` domain object, the module will:

* contribute the `notes` collection, and

* contribute the `addNote(...)` and `removeNote(...)` actions.

Other than implementing the marker interface, the `Notable` domain object will be completely decoupled from the rest of the note module.

In detail:

* have the domain object implement the `Notable` interface: +
+
For example, in the demo app the `NoteDemoObject` implements this interface: +
+
[source,java]
----
public class NoteDemoObject implements Notable {
    ...
}
----
+
This is a marker interface only (no methods need be implemented); it is used only so that Apache Isis knows where to contribute the collections and actions.

* subclass the `NotableLink` abstract class and also implement a domain event subscriber to correctly instantiate
the subclass. +
+
For example, in the demo app the `NotableLinkForDemoObject` implements both of these responsibilities: +
+
[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable(
        identityType= IdentityType.DATASTORE,
        schema="notedemo")
@javax.jdo.annotations.Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceStrategy.NEW_TABLE)
@DomainObject(
        objectType = "notedemo.NotableLinkForDemoObject"
)
public class NotableLinkForDemoObject extends NotableLink {                     // <1>

    @DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
    public static class InstantiationSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {    // <2>
        @Programmatic
        @Subscribe
        public void on(final InstantiateEvent ev) {
            if(ev.getPolymorphicReference() instanceof NoteDemoObject) {
                ev.setSubtype(NotableLinkForDemoObject.class);
            }
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void setPolymorphicReference(final Notable polymorphicReference) {   // <3>
        super.setPolymorphicReference(polymorphicReference);
        setDemoObject((NoteDemoObject) polymorphicReference);
    }

    private NoteDemoObject demoObject;
    @Column(
            allowsNull = "false",
            name = "demoObjectId"
    )
    public NoteDemoObject getDemoObject() {                                     // <4>
        return demoObject;
    }
    public void setDemoObject(final NoteDemoObject demoObject) {
        this.demoObject = demoObject;
    }

    @javax.inject.Inject
    private NoteRepository noteRepository;
}
----
<1> extend from `NotableLink`
<2> implementation of a domain event subscriber that tells the `incode-module-note` which subclass of `NotableLink` to instantiate to handle the polymorphic link between `Note` and the `Notable`.
<3> override the inherited `setPolymorphicReference(...)` method to allow the type-safe reference property to the `Notable` (in this case `NoteDemoObject`) to be set
<4> the type-safe reference property to the `Notable` (in this case `NoteDemoObject`).  In the RDBMS this will correspond to a regular foreign key with referential integrity constraints correctly applied.




=== SPI

The `CalendarNameRepository` interface can optionally be implemented to specify the available calendars for each `Notable` domain object.

For example, in the demo app this is implemented as:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class CalendarNameRepositoryForDemo implements CalendarNameRepository {
    private final Map<Class<?>, List<String>> namesByClass = Maps.newHashMap();
    public CalendarNameRepositoryForDemo() {
        setCalendarNames(NoteDemoObject.class, "BLUE", "GREEN", "RED");
    }
    @Programmatic
    public void setCalendarNames(final Class<?> cls, final String... names) {
        namesByClass.put(cls, Lists.newArrayList(names));
    }
    @Override
    public Collection<String> calendarNamesFor(final Object notable) {
        return namesByClass.get(notable.getClass());
    }
}
----

If no implementation of this interface can be found, then the module provides a single "default" calendar for all `Notable` domain objects.



== Other Services

The module provides the following domain services for querying notes:

* `NoteRepository` +
+
To search for notes by `Notable` or in general within a date range

* `NotableLinkRepository` +
+
To search for `NotableLink`s, ie the tuple that links a `Note` with an arbitrary `Notable` domain object.  This repository is likely to be less useful than `NoteRepository`, but is crucial to the internal workings of the `incode-module-note` module.



== Known issues

None at this time.

== Change Log

* (not yet released) `1.10.0` - released against Isis 1.10.0.



== Forking the repo

If instead you want to extend this module's functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo.  The repo is
structured as follows:

* `pom.xml   ` - parent pom
* `app`        - the demo webapp's `AppManifest`
* `dom       ` - the module implementation, depends on Isis applib
* `fixture   ` - fixtures, holding a sample domain objects and fixture scripts; depends on `dom`
* `integtests` - integration tests for the module; depends on `fixture`
* `webapp    ` - demo webapp (see above screenshots); depends on `dom` and `fixture`

Only the `dom` project is released to Maven Central Repo.  The versions of the other modules are purposely left at
`0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` because they are not intended to be released.

=== Dependencies

Depends upon:

* http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-fullcalendar2[Isis addons' fullcalendar2] wicket extension

both released under Apache v2 license.


=== Icons

The icon for the `Note` entity is provided by https://icons8.com/[Icons8].


==  Maven deploy notes

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

=== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd dom
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].



=== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.10.0 \
              1.11.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master
git push origin 1.10.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again.  Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the 
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo).  You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
