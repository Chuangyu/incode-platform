This component, intended for use with http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis]'s Wicket viewer, allows an entity or collection of
entities to be rendered within a map (using google's https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/[gmap3] API).

== Screenshots

The following screenshots show the example app's usage of the component with some sample fixture data:

=== Parented collection as gmap

The todo item's collection contains a list of `Locatable` entities (also todo items); this is indicated through a button to switch the view:

Clicking the button shows the same entities on a gmap3:

=== Update location using service

The previous screenshot shows the todo item also provides an "update location" action:

[source,java]
----
public Gmap3WicketToDoItem updateLocation(
        @ParameterLayout(named="Address")
        final String address) {
    final Location location = this.locationLookupService.lookup(address);
    setLocation(location);
    return this;
}
----

When invoked:

image::https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-gmap3/master/images/040-update-location-invoke.png[link="https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-gmap3/master/images/040-update-location-invoke.png"]

\... it updates the location:

image::https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-gmap3/master/images/050-location-updated.png[link="https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-gmap3/master/images/050-location-updated.png"]

=== Standalone location as gmap

Invoking an action that returns a list of `Locatable` entities:

image::https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-gmap3/master/images/060-view-all-items.png[link="https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-gmap3/master/images/060-view-all-items.png"]

\... also results in the button to view in a gmap3:

image::https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-gmap3/master/images/070-gmap-button-available-on-standalone-collection.png[link="https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-gmap3/master/images/070-gmap-button-available-on-standalone-collection.png"]

\... which then renders the items in a map. Note the tooltips:

=== Click through

Clicking on a map marker drills down to the entity:

== How to run the Demo App

The prerequisite software is:

* Java JDK 8 (>= Isis 1.9.0) or Java JDK 7 (<= Isis 1.8.0)
** note that the compile source and target remains at JDK 7
* http://maven.apache.org[maven 3] (3.2.x is recommended).

To build the demo app:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-gmap3.git
mvn clean install
----

To run the demo app:

[source,bash]
----
mvn antrun:run -P self-host
----

Then log on using user: `sven`, password: `pass`



== API &  Usage

=== Rendering objects on a map

Make your entity implement `org.isisaddons.wicket.gmap3.applib.Locatable`, such that it provides a `Location` property of type `org.isisaddons.wicket.gmap3.applib.Location`.

This property will need to be annotated as `@javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent`. 

For example:

[sourcemjava]
----
import org.isisaddons.wicket.gmap3.cpt.applib.Locatable;
import org.isisaddons.wicket.gmap3.cpt.applib.Location;

public class ToDoItem implements Locatable {
    ...
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Persistent
    private Location location;

    @MemberOrder(name="Detail", sequence = "10")
    @Optional
    public Location getLocation() { 
        return location;
    }
    public void setLocation(Location location) {
        this.location = location;
    }
}
----

You should then find that any collections of entities that have `Locatable` properties (either returned from an action, or as a parented collection) will be rendered in a map.


=== `LocationLookupService`

By injecting the provided `LocationLookupService` domain service, you can write an action to lookup ``Location``s.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public void lookupLocation(
        @ParameterLayout(named="Description")
        final String description) {
    setLocation(locationLookupService.lookup(description));
}
----

To use this the `LocationLookupService` needs to be registered; see below.

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, the `Location` can also be specified directly as a string. The format is `mmm.mmm;nnn.nnn`, where
`mmm.mmm` is the latitude, and `nnn.nnn` is the longitude
====



=== `LocationDereferencingService`

Sometimes the domain object that implements `Locatable` will be a supporting object such as an `Address`, belonging to a `Customer`, say.
When the location marker is clicked in the map, we would rather that the UI opens up the `Customer` rather than the
associated `Address` (in other words, saving a click).

This requirement is supported by providing an implementation of the `LocationDereferencingService`:

[source,java]
----
public interface LocationDereferencingService {
    @Programmatic
	Object dereference(final Object locatable);
}
----

for example, one might have:

[source,java]
----
public class LocationDereferencingServiceForAddress implements LocationDereferencingService {
    @Programmatic
	public Object dereference(final Object locatable) {
		if (!(locatable instanceof Address)) {
			return null;
		}
		final Address address = (Address) locatable;
		return address.getCustomer();
	}
}
----

Note that there can be multiple implementations of this service; the component will check all that are available.
The order in which they are checked depends upon the `@DomainServiceLayout(menuOrder=...)` attribute.



== How to configure/use

You can either use this component "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements. 

=== "Out-of-the-box"

To use "out-of-the-box", add the component to your project's `dom` module's `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.isisaddons.wicket.gmap3</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-wicket-gmap3-cpt</artifactId>
    <version>1.13.0</version>
</dependency>
----

Check for later releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|isis-wicket-gmap3-cpt[Maven Central Repo].

If you wish to use this the `LocationLookupService`, this needs to be registered:

* 

if using `AppManifest`, then update its `getModules()` method:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public List&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; getModules() {
     return Arrays.asList(
        ...
        org.isisaddons.wicket.gmap3.cpt.service.Gmap3ServiceModule.class,
        ...
     );
}
----


* otherwise, update the `isis.properties` file:

[source,ini]
----
isis.services-installer=configuration-and-annotation
isis.services.ServicesInstallerFromAnnotation.packagePrefix=\
            ...,
            org.isisaddons.wicket.gmap3.cpt,
            ...,
----

And if you have integration tests then register the services' package using `IsisSystemForTest.Builder#withServicesIn(...)` method.


=== "Out-of-the-box" (-SNAPSHOT)

If you want to use the current `-SNAPSHOT`, then the steps are the same as above, except:

* when updating the classpath, specify the appropriate -SNAPSHOT version:

[source,xml]
----
<version>1.14.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
----

* add the repository definition to pick up the most recent snapshot (we use the Cloudbees continuous integration service).  We suggest defining the repository in a `<profile>`:

[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>cloudbees-snapshots</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo</id>
            <url>http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</profile>
----


=== Forking the repo

If instead you want to extend this component's functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo. The repo is
structured as follows:

* `pom.xml` - parent pom
* `cpt` - the component implementation
* `fixture` - fixtures, holding sample domain object classes and fixture scripts
* `webapp` - demo webapp (see above screenshots)

Only the `cpt` project is released to Maven central. The versions of the other modules
are purposely left at `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` because they are not intended to be released.

== Change Log

* `1.13.0` - released against Isis 1.13.0
* `1.12.0` - released against Isis 1.12.0
* `1.11.0` - released against Isis 1.11.0
* `1.10.0` - released against Isis 1.10.0; `LocationDereferencingService`, issues #8 and #9.
* `1.9.0` - released against Isis 1.9.0
* `1.8.0` - released against Isis 1.8.0
* `1.7.0` - released against Isis 1.7.0
* `1.6.0` - re-released as part of isisaddons, with classes under package `org.isisaddons.wicket.gmap3`

==== Dependencies

In addition to Apache Isis, this component depends on:

* `org.wicketstuff:wicketstuff-gmap3` (ASL v2.0 License)

== Maven deploy notes

Only the `cpt` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

==== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source,bash]
----
pushd cpt
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].


=== Release an Interim Build

If you have commit access to this project (or a fork of your own) then you can create interim releases using the `interim-release.sh` script.

The idea is that this will - in a new branch - update the `dom/pom.xml` with a timestamped version (eg `1.13.0.20161017-0738`).
It then pushes the branch (and a tag) to the specified remote.

A CI server such as Jenkins can monitor the branches matching the wildcard `origin/interim/*` and create a build.
These artifacts can then be published to a snapshot repository.

For example:

[source]
----
sh interim-release.sh 1.14.0 origin
----

where

* `1.14.0` is the base release
* `origin` is the name of the remote to which you have permissions to write to.


==== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.13.0 \
              1.14.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master
git push origin 1.13.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again. Note that in the `cpt`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo). You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
