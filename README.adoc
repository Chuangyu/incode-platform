This module, intended for use within http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis], provides an implementation of Isis'
`AuditerService` SPI (introduced in `1.13.0`, replacing the earlier `AuditingService3` SPI).  The implementation
persists audit entries using Isis' own (JDO) objectstore. Typically this will be to a relational database; the
module's `AuditEntry` entity is mapped to the "isisaudit.AuditEntry" table.


== Screenshots

The following screenshots show an example app's usage of the module.

=== Installing the Fixture Data

Install some sample fixture data …

=== Object with initial (creation) audit entries

Because the example entity is annotated with `@DomainObject(auditing = Auditing.ENABLED)`, the initial creation of
that object already results in some audit entries:

image::https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-audit/master/images/02-first-object-with-initial-audit-entries.png[link="https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-audit/master/images/02-first-object-with-initial-audit-entries.png"]

As the screenshot shows, the demo app lists the audit entries for the example entity (a polymorphic association
utilizing the `BookmarkService`).

=== Audit Entry for each changed property

Changing two properties on an object:

which results in _two_ audit entries created, one for each property:

image::https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-audit/master/images/04-two-audit-entries-created.png[link="https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-audit/master/images/04-two-audit-entries-created.png"]


=== Audit entry

The audit entry is an immutable record, can also inspect other audit entries created in the same transaction:

It is of course also possible to navigate back to audited object:

image::https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-audit/master/images/06-navigate-back-to-audited-object.png[link="https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-audit/master/images/06-navigate-back-to-audited-object.png"]


== How to run the Demo App

The prerequisite software is:

* Java JDK 8 (>= 1.9.0) or Java JDK 7 (&lt;= 1.8.0)
** note that the compile source and target remains at JDK 7
* http://maven.apache.org[maven 3] (3.2.x is recommended).

To build the demo app:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-audit.git
mvn clean install
----

To run the demo app:

[source]
----
cd webapp
mvn jetty:run
----

Then log on using user: `sven`, password: `pass`

== Relationship to Apache Isis Core

Isis Core 1.6.0 included the `org.apache.isis.module:isis-module-audit-jdo:1.6.0` Maven artifact. This module is a
direct copy of that code, with the following changes:

* package names have been altered from `org.apache.isis` to `org.isisaddons.module.audit`
* the `persistent-unit` (in the JDO manifest) has changed from `isis-module-audit-jdo` to
 `org-isisaddons-module-audit-dom`

Otherwise the functionality is identical; warts and all!

Isis 1.7.0 (and later) no longer ships the `org.apache.isis.module:isis-module-audit-jdo` module; use this addon module instead.

== How to Configure/Use

You can either use this module "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements. 

=== "Out-of-the-box"

To use "out-of-the-box":

* update your classpath by adding this dependency in your project's `dom` module's `pom.xml`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.isisaddons.module.audit</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-module-audit-dom</artifactId>
    <version>1.13.0</version>
</dependency>
----

* if using `AppManifest`, then update its `getModules()` method: +
+
[source,java]
----
@Override
public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
    return Arrays.asList(
            ...
            org.isisaddons.module.audit.AuditModule.class,
    );
}
----


* otherwise, update your `WEB-INF/isis.properties`: +
+
[source,ini]
----
isis.services-installer=configuration-and-annotation
isis.services.ServicesInstallerFromAnnotation.packagePrefix=\
                ...,\
                org.isisaddons.module.audit.dom,\
                ...
----



Notes:
* Check for later releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|isis-module-audit-dom[Maven Central Repo]. +
+
For audit entries to be created when an object is changed, some configuration is required. This can be either on a case-by-case basis, or globally:

* by default no object is treated as being audited unless it has explicitly annotated using `@Audited`. This is the option used in the example app described above.

* alternatively, auditing can be globally enabled by adding a key to `isis.properties`: +
+
[source,ini]
----
isis.services.audit.objects=all
----

An individual entity can then be explicitly excluded from being audited using `@Audited(disabled=true)`.

=== "Out-of-the-box" (-SNAPSHOT)

If you want to use the current `-SNAPSHOT`, then the steps are the same as above, except:

* when updating the classpath, specify the appropriate -SNAPSHOT version: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<version>1.14.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
----


* add the repository definition to pick up the most recent snapshot (we use the Cloudbees continuous integration service). We suggest defining the repository in a `<profile>`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>cloudbees-snapshots</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo</id>
            <url>http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</profile>
----

=== Forking the repo

If instead you want to extend this module's functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo. The repo is
structured as follows:

* `pom.xml` - parent pom
* `app` - the app module used for bootstrapping, containing the `AppManifest`; depends on `dom` and `fixture`
* `dom` - the module implementation, depends on Isis applib
* `fixture` - fixtures, holding a sample domain objects and fixture scripts; depends on `dom`
* `integtests` - integration tests for the module; depends on `app`
* `webapp` - demo webapp (see above screenshots); depends on `app`

Only the `dom` project is released to Maven Central Repo. The versions of the other modules are purposely left at
`0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` because they are not intended to be released.

== API

The `AuditerService` defines the following API:

[source,java]
----
@Programmatic
public void audit(
        final UUID transactionId, 
        final int sequence,
        final String targetClass,
        final Bookmark target, 
        final String memberIdentifier, 
        final String propertyId,
        final String preValue, 
        final String postValue, 
        final String user, 
        final java.sql.Timestamp timestamp);
----

Isis will automatically call this method on the service implementation if configured. The method is called often, once
for every individual property of a domain object that is changed.

== Implementation

The `AuditerService` API is implemented in this module by the `org.isisaddons.module.audit.AuditerServiceUsingJdo` class.
This implementation simply persists an audit entry (`AuditEntry`) each time it is called. This results in a
fine-grained audit trail.

The `AuditEntry` properties directly correspond to parameters of the `AuditerService` `audit()` API:

[source,java]
----
public class AuditEntry 
    ... 
    private UUID transactionId;
    private int sequence;
    private String targetClass;
    private String targetStr;
    private String memberIdentifier;
    private String propertyId;
    private String preValue;
    private String postValue;
    private String user;
    private Timestamp timestamp;
    ... 
}
----

where:

* `transactionId` is a unique identifier (a GUID) of the transaction in which this audit entry was persisted.
* `timestamp` is the timestamp for the transaction
* `targetClass` holds the class of the audited object, eg `com.mycompany.myapp.Customer`
* `targetStr` stores a serialized form of the `Bookmark`, in other words a provides a mechanism to look up the audited
 object, eg `CUS:1234` to identify customer with id 1234. ("CUS" corresponds to the `@ObjectType` annotation/facet).
* `memberIdentifier` is the fully-qualified class and property Id, similar to the way that Javadoc words, eg
 `com.mycompany.myapp.Customer#firstName`
* `propertyId` is the property identifier, eg `firstName`
* `preValue` holds a string representation of the property's value prior to it being changed. If the object has been
 created then it holds the value "[NEW]". If the string is too long, it will be truncated with ellipses '…'.
* `postValue` holds a string representation of the property's value after it was changed. If the object has been
 deleted then it holds the value "[DELETED]". If the string is too long, it will be truncated with ellipses '…'.

The combination of `transactionId`, `targetStr` and `propertyId` make up an alternative key to uniquely identify an
audit entry. However, there is (deliberately) no uniqueness constraint to enforce this rule.

The `AuditEntry` entity is designed such that it can be rendered on an Isis user interface if required.

== Supporting Services and Mixins

As well as the `AuditingService` service (that implements the `AuditingService3` API), the module also provides two
further domain services:

* The `AuditingServiceMenu` provides actions to search for `AuditEntry`s, underneath an 'Activity' menu on the
secondary menu bar.

* `AuditingServiceRepository` provides the ability to search for persisted (`AuditEntry`) audit entries. None of its
 actions are visible in the user interface (they are all `@Programmatic`) and so this service is automatically
 registered.

* `HasTransactionId_auditEntries` mixin contribues the `auditEntries` collection to the `HasTransactionId` interface.
 This will therefore display all audit entries that occurred in a given transaction, in other words whenever a command,
 a published event or another audit entry is displayed.

(As of 1.8.x and later) these services are automatically registered, meaning that any UI functionality they provide
will appear in the user interface. If this is not required, then either use security permissions or write a vetoing
subscriber on the event bus to hide this functionality, eg:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class HideIsisAddonsAuditingFunctionality extends AbstractSubscriber {
    @Programmatic @Subscribe
    public void on(final AuditingModule.ActionDomainEvent<?> event) { event.hide(); }
}
----

== Related Modules/Services

As well as defining the `AuditingService3` API, Isis' applib also defines several other closely related services.
Implementations of these services are referenced by the http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Add-ons] website.

The `CommandContext` defines the `Command` class which provides request-scoped information about an action
invocation. Commands can be thought of as being the cause of an action; they are created "before the fact". Some
of the parameters passed to `AuditingService3` - such as `target`, `user`, and `timestamp` - correspond exactly to the
`Command` class.

The `CommandService` service is an optional service that acts as a `Command` factory and allows `Command`s to be
persisted. `CommandService`'s API introduces the concept of a `transactionId`; once again this is the same
value as is passed to the `AuditingService3`.

The `PublishingService` is another optional service that allows an event to be published when either an object has
changed or an actions has been invoked. There are some similarities between publishing to auditing; they both occur
"after the fact". However the publishing service's primary use case is to enable inter-system co-ordination (in DDD
terminology, between bounded contexts). As such, publishing is much coarser-grained than auditing, and not every
change need be published. Publishing also uses the `transactionId`.

The `CommandService` and `PublishingService` are optional; as with the `AuditingService3`, Isis will automatically use
call each if the service implementation if discovered on the classpath. 

If all these services are configured - such that commands, audit entries and published events are all persisted, then
the `transactionId` that is common to all enables seamless navigation between each. (This is implemented through
contributed actions/properties/collections; `AuditEntry` implements the `HasTransactionId` interface in Isis' applib,
and it is this interface that each module has services that contribute to).

== Known issues

In `1.6.0` through `1.9.x` a call to `DomainObjectContainer#flush()` is required in order that any newly
created objects are populated. Note that Isis automatically performs a flush prior to any repository call, so in many
cases there may not be any need to call flush explicitly.

== Change Log

* `1.13.0` - updated for Isis 1.13.0, implementing the new `AuditerService` SPI rather than the now deprecated `AuditingService3` SPI.
* `1.12.1` - released against Isis 1.12.1, providing 'Metadata' fieldset, also using lombok and mixins internally
* `1.12.0` - released against Isis 1.12.0
* `1.11.0` - released against Isis 1.11.0
* `1.10.0` - released against Isis 1.10.0
* `1.9.0` - released against Isis 1.9.0; changed mapped of entities to 'isisaudit' schema; updated to use AppManifest
* `1.8.2` - released against Isis 1.8.0; closes <a href="https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-audit/issues/1">#1</a>
* `1.8.1` - released against Isis 1.8.0 (fixed).
* `1.8.0` - released against Isis 1.8.0 (nb: this was a bad release, incorrectly referenced -SNAPSHOT version of Isis core).
* `1.7.0` - released against Isis 1.7.0
* `1.6.0` - re-released as part of isisaddons, with classes under package `org.isisaddons.module.audit`


== Data Migration

The format of the `AuditEntry` table has changed from `1.12.x` to `1.13.x`, incorporating a new `sequence` column
(which is also part of the primary key).

The following script updates the table (SQL Server syntax):

[source,sql]
----
alter table isisaudit.AuditEntry
  add "sequence" int
go

update isisaudit.AuditEntry
   set "sequence" = 0
 where "sequence" is null
go

alter table isisaudit.AuditEntry
  alter column "sequence" not null
go

drop index AuditEntry_ak
  on isisaudit.AuditEntry
go

create index AuditEntry_ak
  on isisaudit.AuditEntry
(
   transactionId ASC,
   "sequence"    ASC,
   target        ASC,
   propertyId    ASC
)
go

==== Dependencies

There are no third-party dependencies.

== Maven deploy notes

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

==== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd dom
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].


=== Release an Interim Build

If you have commit access to this project (or a fork of your own) then you can create interim releases using the `interim-release.sh` script.

The idea is that this will - in a new branch - update the `dom/pom.xml` with a timestamped version (eg `1.13.0.20161017-0738`).
It then pushes the branch (and a tag) to the specified remote.

A CI server such as Jenkins can monitor the branches matching the wildcard `origin/interim/*` and create a build.
These artifacts can then be published to a snapshot repository.

For example:

[source]
----
sh interim-release.sh 1.14.0 origin
----

where

* `1.14.0` is the base release
* `origin` is the name of the remote to which you have permissions to write to.




==== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.13.0 \
              1.14.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master
git push origin 1.13.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again. Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo). You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
