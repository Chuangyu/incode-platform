This component, intended for use with http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis]'s Wicket viewer, integrates http://summernote.org[Summernote editor]. _Summernote_ is a JavaScript library based on http://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap] that helps you create WYSIWYG editors online.


== Screenshots

The following screenshots show the example app's usage of the component with some sample fixture data:

== How to run the Demo App

The prerequisite software is:

* Java JDK 8 (>= 1.9.0)
* http://maven.apache.org[maven 3] (3.2.x is recommended).

To build the demo app:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-summernote.git
mvn clean install
----

To run the demo app:

[source]
----
mvn antrun:run -P self-host
----

Then log on using user: `sven`, password: `pass`

== API & Usage

Annotate any `String` property with `@org.isisaddons.wicket.summernote.cpt.applib.SummernoteEditor`.
You may use the annotation attributes to configure some aspects of the rich editor, e.g. its maximum height.

[source,java]
----
import org.isisaddons.wicket.summernote.cpt.applib.SummernoteEditor;

public class SummernoteEditorToDoItem implements Comparable<SummernoteEditorToDoItem> {
    ...
    private String notes = "";

    @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull="true", length=400)
    @SummernoteEditor(height = 100, maxHeight = 300)
    public String getNotes() {
        return notes;
    }
    ...
}.
----

== How to configure/use

You can either use this component "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements.

==== "Out-of-the-box"

To use "out-of-the-box", add the component to your project's `dom` module's `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.isisaddons.wicket.summernote</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-wicket-summernote-cpt</artifactId>
    <version>1.12.0</version>
</dependency>
----

Check for later releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|isis-wicket-summernote-cpt[Maven Central Repo].

==== "Out-of-the-box" (-SNAPSHOT)

If you want to use the current `-SNAPSHOT`, then the steps are the same as above, except:

* when updating the classpath, specify the appropriate -SNAPSHOT version: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<version>1.13.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
----

* add the repository definition to pick up the most recent snapshot (we use the Cloudbees continuous integration service).  We suggest defining the repository in a `<profile>`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>cloudbees-snapshots</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo</id>
            <url>http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</profile>
----

* ensure that the module's facet factory that locates the `SummerEditor` annotation is added to Isis' metamodel: +
+
[source,properties]
----
isis.reflector.facets.include=org.isisaddons.wicket.summernote.cpt.applib.SummernoteEditorFacetFactory
----


#### Forking the repo ####

If instead you want to extend these components' functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo. The repo is
structured as follows:

* `pom.xml` - parent pom
* `cpt` - the component implementation
* `fixture` - fixtures, holding a sample domain objects and fixture scripts
* `webapp` - demo webapp (see above screenshots)

Only the `cpt` project (and its submodules) is released to Maven central. The versions of the other modules
are purposely left at `0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` because they are not intended to be released.

== Change Log

* `1.12.0` - released against Isis 1.12.0
* `1.11.0` - First version. Released against Isis 1.12.0

== Legal Stuff

The Summernote editor is licenced under the MIT licence.

The IsisAddons Summernote wicket component is licenced under the Apache 2 licence.

== Maven deploy notes

Only the `cpt` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

==== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd cpt
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].

==== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.13.0 \
              1.14.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master
git push origin 1.13.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again. Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo). You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
