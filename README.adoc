This module, intended for use with link:http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis], provides the ability to create `Document` objects to arbitrary domain objects. 


== Domain Model

=== Document, DocumentTemplate, Binder & Paperclip

The following class diagram highlights the main concepts:

image::http://yuml.me/e181888a[link="http://yuml.me/e181888a", width="600px"]

(The colours used in the diagram are - approximately - from link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Modeling_in_Color[Object Modeling in Color]).

The central concept is, of course, `Document`.
``Document``s have content that is either a Blob, Clob or is text, these attributes being defined in the `DocumentAbstract` supertype (more on this shortly).
Alternatively, the ``Document``'s content can be stored externally, eg in a CMS or cloud storage service, in which case the ``Document``'s own `externalUrl` attribute is used.
The `DocumentSort` determines how the content of the `Document` is physically stored (along with the supporting `DocumentNature` and `DocumentStorage` enums).
Conceptually ``Document``s are immutable (though if their content is moved to an external URL, the original entity would be update in that case).

Each `Document` also has a corresponding `DocumentType`, eg "Invoice" or perhaps a form id, eg "ABC123".

The `DocumentTemplate` is also a document (ie subclass of `DocumentAbstract`), however its content will have placeholders.
These placeholders are populated with respect to some sort of domain object acting as an input (like a "mail merge"), to generate a resultant `Document`.
The `DocumentTemplate` also has a `DocumentType`, and so it is the `DocumentType` that acts as the link between the `DocumentTemplate` with the ``Document``s created from those templates.
It is possible for there to be multiple ``DocumentTemplate``s over time for a particular `DocumentType` (distinguished by date), to allow for minor changes to a template over time.
The domain model deliberately does *not* keep track of which particular `DocumentTemplate` was used to create a `Document`, just the type is used.

Each `DocumentTemplate` has an associated set of ``Applicability``s.  Each of these identifies a domain class that can be used as an input the rendering of the `DocumentTemplate`, with a corresponding implementation of the `Binder` interface being responsible for actually creating an input "data model" used to feed into the template.

Each `DocumentTemplate` also has a `RenderingStrategy`, meaning a mechanism to actually produce its content from the template text (once its placeholders have been replaced by "data model" provided by the `Binder`).

Every `Document` is created from a `DocumentTemplate`, but rather than hold a reference to this original template, instead `Document` and `DocumentTemplate` are unified through the `DocumentType` entity.
The document type can be considered as a set of versioned ``DocumentTemplate``s (identified by date), along with all the ``Document``s that were created from (any of) those ``DocumentTemplate``s.

Once a `Document` has been created it is attached to one or more target domain object using `Paperclip`.
This requires a custom subclass for the domain object in question; the polymorphic pattern ("table of two halves") is used for this linkage.


Based upon the implementation of `RenderingStrategy` and `Renderer`, each `DocumentTemplate` can support either previewing and/or rendering.
Previewing means to return a representation as a URL; the end-user can then navigate to this URL without any change in state to the application.
Rendering on the other hand means the creation and persisting of a `Document` from the `DocumentTemplate`.

The `createDocument()` mixin is contributed to all domain objects where there is a `DocumentTemplate` available for the domain object's application tenancy path (`atPath`) that supports either previewing and/or rendering.
However, for rendering there must also be at least one domain objects to which the resultant `Document` can be attached; if there are none available, then create/save will be suppressed.
The `Binder` is used to identify which domain objects the resultant `Document` is attached to; there must be at least one such domain object available (ie that has its own subclass of `Paperclip`).


=== RenderingStrategy & Renderer

The  `Renderer` interface has the following subtypes and (example) implementations:

image::http://yuml.me/b63e782f[link="http://yuml.me/b63e782f", width="800px"]

The owning `RenderingStrategy` for each `Renderer` identifies the nature of the inputs and outputs (bytes or characters) of each `RenderingStrategy`; the associated `Renderer` implementation must meet those constraints.
Note that a `Renderer` may produce nature of the inputs vs outputs may vary: a character template might result in byte array output.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


== How to configure/use

You can either use this module "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements. 

=== "Out-of-the-box"

To use "out-of-the-box":

* update your classpath by adding this dependency in your dom project's `pom.xml`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.incode.module.document</groupId>
    <artifactId>incode-module-document-dom</artifactId>
    <version>1.13.0</version>
</dependency>
----

* in the `AppManifest`, update its `getModules()` method: +
+
[source,java]
----
@Override
public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
    return Arrays.asList(
            ...
            org.incode.module.document.dom.DocumentModule.class,
    );
}
----



Notes:

* Check for later releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|incode-module-document-dom[Maven Central Repo].


==== "Out-of-the-box" (-SNAPSHOT)

If you want to use the current `-SNAPSHOT`, then the steps are the same as above, except:

* when updating the classpath, specify the appropriate -SNAPSHOT version:

[source,xml]
----
<version>1.14.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
----

* add the repository definition to pick up the most recent snapshot (we use the Cloudbees continuous integration service).  
We suggest defining the repository in a `<profile>`:

[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>cloudbees-snapshots</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo</id>
            <url>http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false>/enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</profile>
----


=== Input

For each domain object that you want to use as the input data to a `DocumentTemplate`, you need to:

* implement `ApplicationTenancyService` +
+
To return the application tenancy path of the domain object in order that available ``DocumentTemplate``s can be located

* implement a `Binder` +
+
These have two similar responsibilities: to construct the "data model" from the input domain object, and to identify the
 object(s) to which the resultant `Document` is attached. +
+
[NOTE]
====
It could be that a ``Binder``'s two responsibilities are quite separate from each other.  
However, in the vast majority of cases the input domain object and the object to attach the resultant `Document` to will be same, hence the decision to combine these responsibilities into a single interface.
====

The `ApplicationTenancyService` is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public interface ApplicationTenancyService {
    String atPathFor(final Object domainObject);
}
----

while `Binder` is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public interface Binder {
    Binding newBinding(
            final DocumentTemplate documentTemplate,        // <1>
            final Object domainObject,                      // <2>
            final String additionalTextIfAny);              // <3>
}
----
<1> the template to which this binder implementation applies, as per `DocumentTemplate#getAppliesTo()` and `Applicability#getBinderClassName()`
<2> the domain object acting as the context for the binding, from which both the input data model and the objects to attach to (see `Binding`, below) are inferred
<3> optional text (eg for an email cover note) that may also be available to create the input data model

and `Binding` is in turn:

[source,java]
----
public class Binding {
    ...
    private final Object dataModel;
    private final List<Object> attachTo;
    public Binding(
            final Object dataModel,          // <1>
            final List<Object> attachTo) {   // <2>
        this.dataModel = dataModel;
        this.attachTo = attachTo;
    }
}
----
<1> used as input to the `RenderingStrategy`.
<2> specifies where to attach the domain object



=== Renderers

For each rendering technology, an implementation of `Renderer` is required.  
A number of such ``Rendererer``s have been developed, using Freemarker, XDocReport or just capturing the content of arbitrary URLs (eg as exposed by an external reporting server such as SQL Server Reporting Services).



=== Paperclips (attach output)

For each domain object that you want to attach ``Document``s (that is, add ``Paperclip``s to), you need to

* implement a subclass of `Paperclip` for the domain object's type. +
+
This link acts as a type-safe tuple linking the domain object to the `Document`.

* implement the `PaperclipRepository.SubtypeProvider` SPI interface: +
+
[source,java]
----
public interface SubtypeProvider {
    Class<? extends Paperclip> subtypeFor(Class<?> domainObject);
}
----
+
This tells the module which subclass of `Paperclip` to use to attach to the domain object to attach to.  
The `SubtypeProviderAbstract` adapter can be used to remove some boilerplate.


For example:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable(identityType=IdentityType.DATASTORE)
@javax.jdo.annotations.Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceStrategy.NEW_TABLE)
@DomainObject(objectType = "estatioAssets.PaperclipForInvoice")
@DomainObjectLayout( bookmarking = BookmarkPolicy.AS_ROOT)
public class PaperclipForInvoice extends Paperclip {                    // <1>

    @Column( allowsNull = "false", name = "invoiceId" )
    @Getter @Setter
    private Invoice invoice;

    @NotPersistent
    @Override
    public Object getAttachedTo() {                                     // <2>
        return getInvoice();
    }
    @Override
    protected void setAttachedTo(final Object object) {
        setInvoice((Invoice) object);
    }

    @DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
    public static class SubtypeProvider                                 // <3>
            extends PaperclipRepository.SubtypeProviderAbstract {
        public SubtypeProvider() {
            super(Invoice.class, PaperclipForInvoice.class);
        }
    }
}
----
<1> inherit from `Paperclip`
<2> implement hook methods
<3> SubtypeProvider SPI implementation


[NOTE]
====
To view the ``Paperclip``s once created there is also a `T_paperclips` mixin collection, discussed below.
====


=== Mixins

==== T_createDocumentAndRender, T_createDocumentAndScheduleRender

The document module is fully data-driven, in that the ability to be able to create a document for any given domain entity is defined by the data held in `DocumentTemplate` (its `atPath`) and `Applicability` (the `domainClassName` and corresponding `Binder` implementation).

The `T_createDocumentAndRender` and `T_createDocumentAndScheduleRender` mixin actions exposes this functionality for any domain class, by simply subclassing. 
The former renders in the foreground, while the latter creates a background command so that the rendering can be performed asynchronously.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Mixin
public class Invoice_createDocument extends T_createDocumentAndRender<Invoice> {
    public Invoice_createDocument(Invoice invoice) { super(invoice); }
}
----

Add similar mixins for all classes where there exists a `DocumentTemplate` and `Applicability` capable of consuming the object as an input to the template.

[TIP]
====
If you want make this action available for all domain objects, simply use:

[source,java]
----
@Mixin
public class Object_createDocument extends T_createDocumentAndRender<Object> {
    public Object_createDocument(Object object) { super(object); }
}
----

If there is no `DocumentTemplate`/`Applicability`, then the action will be hidden in the UI.  
The reason that the module doesn't just provide this mixin out-of-the-box is (a) for consistency with other modules and (b) for understandability/traceability ("not *too* much magic").
====


==== T_documents

The `T_documents` mixin collection returns the list of ``Paperclip``s that each attach a `Document` to the specified domain object.

Since ``Paperclip``s can only be created for domain objects where a subclass of `Paperclip` has been defined (see above), it's typical for this mixin to be defined as a nested static class of that `Paperclip` subclass.
For example:

[source,java]
----
...
public class PaperclipForInvoice extends Paperclip {
    ...
    @Mixin
    public static class _documents extends T_paperclips<Invoice> {
        public _documents(final Invoice invoice) {
            super(invoice);
        }
    }
}
----


=== Optional SPI Services

==== BinderClassNameService

The `BinderClassNameService`, if implemented, provides UI to allow the binder class name to be changed on an `Applicability`:

[source,java]
----
public interface BinderClassNameService {
    List<ClassNameViewModel> binderClassNames();
}
----

This can most conveniently be implemented using the `ClassNameServiceAbstract` convenience class, eg:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class BinderClassNameServiceForEstatio extends ClassNameServiceAbstract<Binder> implements
        BinderClassNameService {

    private static final String PACKAGE_PREFIX = "org.estatio";

    public BinderClassNameServiceForEstatio() {
        super(Binder.class, PACKAGE_PREFIX);
    }

    @Override
    public List<ClassNameViewModel> binderClassNames() {
        return this.classNames();
    }
}
----

==== UrlDownloadService

The `UrlDownloadService` is used to download any ``Document``s whose content is stored as an external URL, eg in an on-site CMS or on a cloud storage service.

A default implementation of this service is provided that simply uses Java's `HttpUrlConnection` to download the URL; in particular the URL must be accessible and require no user credentials/passwords.

The service can be optionally overridden if credentials are required.

The service is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public interface UrlDownloadService {
    public Blob downloadAsBlob(final Document document) { ... }
    public Clob downloadAsClob(final Document document) { ... }
}
----


==== DocumentEmailSupportService

The `DocumentEmailSupportService` ...

[source,java]
----
public interface DocumentEmailSupportService {
    DocumentType blankDocumentType();                   // <1>
    void inferHeaderFor(
        Document document,                              // <2>
        EmailHeader header);                            // <3>
}
----
<1> returns a `DocumentType` where the supplied content and subject model is returned unchanged
<2> the `Document` for which the email is to be created
<3> the `EmailHeader` to be populated, specifying the to:, cc: etc details.

where `EmailHeader` is:

[source,java]
----
public class EmailHeader {
    @Getter @Setter
    private String subject;
    @Getter
    private final Set<EmailAddress> toSet = Sets.newTreeSet();
    @Getter
    private final Set<EmailAddress> ccSet = Sets.newTreeSet();
    @Getter
    private final Set<EmailAddress> bccSet = Sets.newTreeSet();
    @Getter @Setter
    private EmailAddress from;
}
----



== Known issues

(none)


== Change Log

* `1.13.0` - released against Isis 1.13.0



== Forking the repo

If instead you want to extend this module's functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo.  The repo is
structured as follows:

* `pom.xml` - parent pom
* `dom` - the module implementation, depends on Isis applib


////////////////////////////////////////////////////
* `app` - the demo webapp's `AppManifest`
* `fixture` - fixtures, holding a sample domain objects and fixture scripts; depends on `dom`
* `integtests` - integration tests for the module; depends on `fixture`
* `webapp` - demo webapp (see above screenshots); depends on `dom` and `fixture`

Only the `dom` project is released to Maven Central Repo.  The versions of the other modules are purposely left at
`0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` because they are not intended to be released.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Note that the module uses link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok].  To compile the code within your IDE you will
therefore require the appropriate Lombok plugin.  See the link:https://projectlombok.org/download.html[Lombok download page] for more information.

=== Dependencies

None.


=== Icons

The icons are provided by https://icons8.com/[Icons8].


==  Maven deploy notes

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

=== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd dom
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].



=== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.14.0 \
              1.15.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master
git push origin 1.14.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again.  Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the 
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo).  You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
