This module, intended for use with link:http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis], provides the ability to attach `Alias`
objects to arbitrary domain objects, where "alias" means an alternative identifier for the object.  Most commonly this
is the identifier within some external system (in DDD terms: in some other bounded context).

The identity of the external system itself is represented in two ways: first by the "alias type" (general ledger,
document management system" etc), and also by an "application tenancy path".  The latter is the same concept as exists
within the link:http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Addons]' link:http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security[security]
module, and generally represents a multi-tenancy environment, eg to distinguish different countries. Thus, an `Alias`
is the combination of the app tenancy, an alias type, and the alias reference itself (a simple string).

For example, a `Party` entity might have a different identifier within a general ledger system for France say, and
another identifier again in centrally-managed document management system.

There are _no_ requirements for domain objects with aliases implement any interfaces.  Instead, `Alias` is an
abstract class; the consuming application provides a subclass of `Alias` and related classes to act
as the "glue" between the `Alias` and the "aliased" domain object.  In total about
link:https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias/blob/master/fixture/src/main/java/org/incode/module/alias/fixture/app/alias/AliasForDemoObject.java[50 lines of boilerplate]
are required, details below.

This module places no constraints on either the alias type nor on the format of the application tenancy path.  The
alias type is represented by the `AliasType`; to use the module the application must implement the mandatory
`AliasTypeRepository` SPI service which identifies the available ``AliasType``s.  Similarly, the available application
tenancy paths are provided to the module by the mandatory `ApplicationTenancyRepository` SPI service.  In both cases
the list of alias types and application tenancy paths is per aliased domain object; not every aliased object will have
an alias in every external system.


== Domain Model

The following http://yuml.me[] class diagram highlights the main concepts:

image::http://yuml.me/b1ee9148[link="http://yuml.me/b1ee9148"]

(The colours used in the diagram are - approximately - from link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Modeling_in_Color[Object Modeling in Color]).



== Screenshots

The following screenshots show the demo app's usage of the module.  We start by installing some demo fixture data:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias/master/images/010-run-fixture-script.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias/master/images/010-run-fixture-script.png"]

This installs some very simple (demo) domain objects, the first of which is returned.  These aliasable objects have
a (contributed) `aliases` collection, and we can also add new aliases using a (contributed) `addAlias(...)` action:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias/master/images/040-add-alias.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias/master/images/040-add-alias.png"]

The action requires the application tenancy of the alias (as returned from the `ApplicationTenancyRepository` SPI service) to be specified:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias/master/images/050-enter-alias-details.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias/master/images/050-enter-alias-details.png"]

and also the alias type (as returned from the `AliasTypeRepository` SPI service) to be specified:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias/master/images/052-enter-alias-details.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias/master/images/052-enter-alias-details.png"]

and finally the external alias reference itself must be specified also:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias/master/images/054-enter-alias-details.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias/master/images/054-enter-alias-details.png"]


The aliases for the `Alias` domain object is added to:

Each `Alias` can also be viewed:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias/master/images/070-view-alias.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias/master/images/070-view-alias.png"]



== How to run the Demo App

The prerequisite software is:

* Java JDK 8
* http://maven.apache.org[maven 3] (3.2.x or later is recommended).

To build the demo app:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/incodehq/isis-module-alias.git
mvn clean install
----

To run the demo app:

[source]
----
cd webapp
mvn jetty:run
----

Then log on using user: `sven`, password: `pass`


== How to configure/use

You can either use this module "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements. 

=== "Out-of-the-box"

To use "out-of-the-box":

* update your classpath by adding this dependency in your dom project's `pom.xml`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.incode.module.alias</groupId>
    <artifactId>incode-module-alias-dom</artifactId>
    <version>1.13.0</version>
</dependency>
----

* in the `AppManifest`, update its `getModules()` method: +
+
[source,java]
----
@Override
public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
    return Arrays.asList(
            ...
            org.incode.module.alias.dom.AliasModule.class,
    );
}
----



Notes:

* Check for later releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|incode-module-alias-dom[Maven Central Repo].


==== "Out-of-the-box" (-SNAPSHOT)

If you want to use the current `-SNAPSHOT`, then the steps are the same as above, except:

* when updating the classpath, specify the appropriate -SNAPSHOT version:

[source,xml]
----
<version>1.14.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
----

* add the repository definition to pick up the most recent snapshot (we use the Cloudbees continuous integration service).  We suggest defining the repository in a `<profile>`:

[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>cloudbees-snapshots</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo</id>
            <url>http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false>/enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</profile>
----


=== For each domain object...

In order to be able to add/remove aliases to a domain object, you need to:

* implement a subclass of `Alias` for the domain object's type.  +
+
This is the object that will be polymorphically attached to the "aliased" domain object; the subtype provides the
type-safe association (a foreign key within the RDBMS).

* implement the `SubtypeProvider` SPI interface: +
+
[source,java]
----
public interface SubtypeProvider {
    Class<? extends Alias> subtypeFor(Class<?> domainObject);
}
----
+
This tells the module which subclass of `Alias` to use to attach to the "aliased" domain object.  The
`SubtypeProviderAbstract` adapter can be used to remove some boilerplate.

* subclass `T_addAlias`, `T_removeAlias` and `T_aliases` (abstract) mixin classes for the domain object. +
+
These contribute the "aliases" collection and actions to add and remove ``Alias``es.

Typically the SPI implementations and the mixin classes are nested static classes of the `Alias` subtype.

For example, in the demo app the `DemoObject` domain object can have aliases by virtue of the 
link:https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias/blob/master/fixture/src/main/java/org/incode/module/alias/fixture/app/alias/AliasForDemoObject.java[`AliasForDemoObject`]
subclass:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable(identityType= IdentityType.DATASTORE, schema="incodeAliasDemo")
@javax.jdo.annotations.Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceStrategy.NEW_TABLE)
@DomainObject(objectType = "incodeAliasDemo.AliasForDemoObject")
public class AliasForDemoObject extends Alias {                                             // <1>

    private DemoObject demoObject;
    @Column(allowsNull = "false", name = "demoObjectId")
    @Property(editing = Editing.DISABLED)
    public AliasDemoObject getDemoObject() {                                                // <2>
        return demoObject;
    }
    public void setDemoObject(final AliasDemoObject demoObject) {
        this.demoObject = demoObject;
    }

    public Object getAliased() {                                                            // <3>
        return getDemoObject();
    }
    protected void setAliased(final Object aliased) {
        setDemoObject((AliasDemoObject) aliased);
    }

    @DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
    public static class SubtypeProvider extends AliasRepository.SubtypeProviderAbstract {   // <4>
        public LinkProvider() {
            super(DemoObject.class, AliasForDemoObject.class);
        }
    }

    @Mixin
    public static class _aliases extends T_aliases<DemoObject> {                            // <5>
        public _aliases(final AliasDemoObject aliased) {
            super(aliased);
        }
    }
    @Mixin
    public static class _addAlias extends T_addAlias<DemoObject> {
        public _addAlias(final AliasObject aliased) {
            super(aliased);
        }
    }
    @Mixin
    public static class _removeAlias extends T_removeAlias<DemoObject> {
        public _removeAlias(final DemoObject aliased) {
            super(aliased);
        }
    }
}
----
<1> extend from `Alias`
<2> the type-safe reference property to the "aliased" domain object (in this case `DemoObject`).  In the RDBMS
this will correspond to a regular foreign key with referential integrity constraints correctly applied.
<3> implement the hook `setAliased(...)` method to allow the type-safe reference property to the "aliased" (in this
case `DemoObject`) to be set.  Also implemented `getAliased()` similarly
<4> implementation of the `SubtypeProvider` SPI domain service, telling the module which subclass of `Alias`
to instantiate to attach to the "aliased" domain object
<5> mixins for the collections and actions contributed to the "aliased" domain object


=== SPI services

There are two further mandatory SPI domain services that must be implemented:

* First, the `ApplicationTenancyRepository` returns the application tenancy (path)s that are available to locate
alias types for a given aliased: +
+
[source,java]
----
public interface ApplicationTenancyRepository {
    Collection<String> atPathsFor(final Object domainObjectToAlias);
}
----
+
Note that this isn't (necessarily) the same as the application tenancy path of the object being aliased; rather it is
the list of the paths available (eg: countries/regions) for which there is an alias type (eg an external system) that
may contain an alias (external system identifier).

* Second, the `AliasTypeRepository` interface returns the available alias types for a given application tenancy path and
aliased: +
+
[source,java]
----
public interface AliasTypeRepository {
    Collection<AliasType> aliasTypesFor(final Object aliased, final String atPath);
}
----
+
where `AliasType` is defined as the interface: +
+
[source,java]
----
public interface AliasType {
    String getId();
}
----
+
Typically `AliasType` will be implemented as an entity or perhaps a view model.  The "id" is used as a column in
the database tables, but in the UI the end-user sees the title of the object that implements the interface.
+
[WARNING]
====
Currently (as of v1.13.0) the Apache Isis framework does not support enums implementing interfaces; the example app
shows how a view model can be used as a work-around.
====

Note that there can be multiple implementations of either of these interfaces.  This is to support the use case that
different unrelated entities in the application may have aliases; each such aliased object can have its own supporting
implementations of these SPI interfaces.



== UI Concerns

The attached `Alias` objects are shown in two contexts: as a table of `Alias` objects for the "aliased" domain object,
and then as the actual subtype when the alias object itself is shown (eg `AliasForDemoObject` in the demo app).

In the former case (as a table) the `Alias` will be rendered according to the `Alias.layout.xml` provided by the module.
In the latter (as an object) the alias will be rendered according to the layout provided by the consuming app, offering
full control of the layout.  The layout provided in the demo app
(ie link:https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias/blob/master/fixture/src/main/java/org/incode/module/alias/fixture/app/alias/AliasForDemoObject.layout.xml[`AliasForDemoObject.layout.xml`])
is a good starting point.

[TIP]
====
The example `AliasForDemoObject.layout.xml` uses a little bit of custom CSS to adjust the right-hand column down
a number of pixels.  This resides in link:https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias/blob/master/webapp/src/main/webapp/css/application.css[`application.css`]:

[source,css]
----
.entityPage.org-incode-module-alias-fixture-dom-alias-AliasForDemoObject .alias-col {
    padding-top: 41px;
}
----
====

The module also allows the title, icon and CSS for `Alias` objects to be customised.  By default the values for these
are obtained using default subscribers, namely - `Alias.TitleSubscriber`, `Alias.IconSubscriber` and
`Alias.CssClassSubscriber`.  The consuming module can override these values simply by providing alternative
implementations.

For example, the demo app has this demo implementation:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN )
public class DemoUiSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {

    @Subscribe
    public void on(Alias.TitleUiEvent ev) {
        Alias alias = ev.getSource();
        if(isType(alias, AliasTypeDemoEnum.DOCUMENT_MANAGEMENT)) {
            ev.setTitle("DocMgmt  [" + alias.getAliasTypeId() + "] " + alias.getReference());
        }
    }

    @Subscribe
    public void on(Alias.IconUiEvent ev) {
        Alias alias = ev.getSource();
        if(isType(alias, AliasTypeDemoEnum.DOCUMENT_MANAGEMENT)) {
            ev.setIconName("Alias-docMgmt");
        } else if (isType(alias, AliasTypeDemoEnum.GENERAL_LEDGER)) {
            ev.setIconName("Alias-GL");
        }
    }

    @Subscribe
    public void on(Alias.CssClassUiEvent ev) {
        Alias alias = ev.getSource();
        ev.setCssClass("Alias" + alias.getAtPath().replace("/", "-"));
    }

    private static boolean isType(final Alias alias, final AliasTypeDemoEnum aliasType) {
        return alias.getAliasTypeId().equals(aliasType.getId());
    }
}
----

which returns a different title, icon and alias.

The custom png icons are picked up from `org.incode.module.alias.dom.impl` package (in this case, `Alias-docMgmt.png`
and `Alias-GL.png`;see the link:https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias/tree/master/fixture/src/main/java/org/incode/module/alias/dom/impl[source] ).
The custom CSS is supplied in the link:https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias/blob/master/webapp/src/main/webapp/css/application.css[`application.css`]
of the demo app:

[source,css]
----
tr.Alias-nl {
    color: blueviolet;
}
tr.Alias-uk {
    color: chocolate;
}
----



== Other Services

The module provides one further domain service, namely `AliasRepository`.  This can be used for finding the aliases
attached to an "aliased" object.




== Known issues

(As noted above), as of v1.13.0 the Apache Isis framework does not support enums implementing interfaces; the example
app shows how a view model can be used as a work-around.


== Change Log

* `1.13.0` - released against Isis 1.13.0; removed the `Aliasable` interface (to completely decouple the
"aliased" domain object from this module); removed dependency on poly module, instead using the (broadly equivalent)
new `SubtypeProvider` SPI; combined `Alias` and `AliasLink` into a single entity; added in the ability to override the
title, icon and CSS of `Alias` objects; using `.layout.xml` for layouts.
* `1.12.0` - released against Isis 1.12.0
* `1.11.1` - released against Isis 1.11.1.



== Forking the repo

If instead you want to extend this module's functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo.  The repo is
structured as follows:

* `pom.xml` - parent pom
* `app` - the demo webapp's `AppManifest`
* `dom` - the module implementation, depends on Isis applib
* `fixture` - fixtures, holding a sample domain objects and fixture scripts; depends on `dom`
* `integtests` - integration tests for the module; depends on `fixture`
* `webapp` - demo webapp (see above screenshots); depends on `dom` and `fixture`

Only the `dom` project is released to Maven Central Repo.  The versions of the other modules are purposely left at
`0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` because they are not intended to be released.

Note that the module uses link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok].  To compile the code within your IDE you will
therefore require the appropriate Lombok plugin.  See the link:https://projectlombok.org/download.html[Lombok download page] for more information.

=== Dependencies

None.


=== Icons

The icons are provided by https://icons8.com/[Icons8].


==  Maven deploy notes

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

=== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd dom
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].



=== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.14.0 \
              1.15.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master
git push origin 1.14.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again.  Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the 
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo).  You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
