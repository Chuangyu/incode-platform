This module, intended for use with link:http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis], provides the ability to attach
communication channel objects (postal address, email or phone/fax number) to domain objects.  Domain objects are
required to implement the `CommunicationChannelOwner` marker interface, and must implement a subclass from the
`CommunicationChannelOwnerLink` (about 40 lines of boilerplate, details below).

For postal address, the geocoding data can be looked up by invoking the
link:https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding[Google Geocoding] API.  This allows free-form text
entry of an address to be converted into its geocoded equivalent, including latitude and longitude.  This in turn
allows each postal address object to implement the `Location` interface (from
link:http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-gmap3[Gmap3 wicket component]) meaning that they can be rendered in a
map view.

Each communication channel object can optionally be categorized with a predefined "purpose", where the available list
of "purposes" is defined by the optional `CommunicationChannelPurposeRepository` SPI service.  The list of purposes can
vary by both the communication channel type (postal address/email/phone) and also by `CommunicationChannelOwner`; for
example address objects the list could be "billing address" and "shipping address", whereas for emails the list of purposes
might be "work email" or "home email".


== Screenshots

The following screenshots show an example app's usage of the module.

We start by installing some demo fixture data:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/020-recreate-fixtures.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/020-recreate-fixtures.png"]


The fixture data sets up a number of demo objects that implement the `CommunicationChannelOwner` interface, along with
some sample ``CommunicationChannel``s for each.  These are shown in the contributed `communicationChannels` collection:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/030-communication-channels-collection-mixed-in.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/030-communication-channels-collection-mixed-in.png"]


Also contributed are actions to create new communication channels of each of the three main types.  For example, we
can create a new `PostalAddress`:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/040-new-postal-address-action.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/040-new-postal-address-action.png"]

Because postal addresses can vary so much around the world, the module defines only "address lines" (rather than house
street number, street address, district and so on).  Apart from the first address line, these are all optional.



Completing the action updates the list of communication channels for the communication channel owner:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/050-communication-channels-added-to.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/050-communication-channels-added-to.png"]



Each communication channel can be viewed and updated.  The `PostalAddress` is the most complex:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/060-postal-address-detail.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/060-postal-address-detail.png"]


Specifically, the postal address allows geocoding data to be looked up from the
link:https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding[Google Geocoding] API.  The address lines information
entered previously is used for the search, but this can be adjusted as necessary by the end-user:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/070-lookup-geocode.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/070-lookup-geocode.png"]



The geocoding data consists of the latitude and longitude, but also of a unique place Id.  It also contains various
other more detailed information, such as the various components that make up the address.

In addition, the raw JSON from the geocoding API request can be downloaded:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/080-download-geocode.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/080-download-geocode.png"]


specifying a filename:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/090-download-geocode-specify-filename.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/090-download-geocode-specify-filename.png"]


and viewed:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/110-geocode-file.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/110-geocode-file.png"]



All communication channel have a "purpose", which can be updated:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/120-update-postal-address-purpose.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/120-update-postal-address-purpose.png"]



The list of available purposes varies by channel type, for example "Billing Address" or "Shipping Address" for
``PostalAddress``es, "Home Email" or "Work Email" for ``EmailAddress``es, etc:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/130-purpose-defined-by-spi-service.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/130-purpose-defined-by-spi-service.png"]

The list itself is not hardcoded into the module, however; instead it is defined by the
`CommunicationChannelPurposeRepository` optional SPI.  If there is no implementation of this SPI service then a default
"purpose" is used



Every communication channel also allows adhoc notes to be added:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/140-update-notes.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/140-update-notes.png"]



When creating a new `PostalAddress`, the geocode information can be looked up at the same time using the final checkbox
parameter for the action:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/160-another-postal-address-lookup-geocode.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/160-another-postal-address-lookup-geocode.png"]



The `PostalAddress` entity implements the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-gmap3[Isis addons' gmap3]
wicket extension's `Locatable` interface, meaning that it can be rendered on a map.  Assuming that the extension has
been configured on the classpath:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/170-lookup-as-map.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/170-lookup-as-map.png"]



Then the map is rendered:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/180-map-view.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/180-map-view.png"]



The module also allows new ``EmailAddress``es to be created:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/190-new-email-address.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/190-new-email-address.png"]


And similarly allows new ``PhoneOrFaxNumber``s to be created:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/200-new-phone-or-fax-number.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/200-new-phone-or-fax-number.png"]



What can be created and modified can also be deleted.  Each of the `CommunicationChannel` objects provide an action
to remove them:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/210-remove-communication-channel.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/210-remove-communication-channel.png"]



As the screenshot shows, the end-user has the option of specifying some other communication channel (of the same type)
as a "replacement".   Because each action has a corresponding domain event, this allows for cascade updates scenarios
(where other objects that depend upon the channel being deleted can instead refer to its replacement).

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/220-are-you-sure-prompt.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-commchannel/master/images/220-are-you-sure-prompt.png"]


Alternatively, subscribers can opt to veto the removal/deletion of a communication channel.  This is done using the
standard technique described in the link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ug.html#_ug_more-advanced_decoupling_event-bus[Apache Isis user guide].




== How to run the Demo App

The prerequisite software is:

* Java JDK 8
* http://maven.apache.org[maven 3] (3.2.x or later is recommended).

To build the demo app:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-commchannel.git
mvn clean install
----

To run the demo app:

[source]
----
mvn antrun:run -P self-host
----

Then log on using user: `sven`, password: `pass`




== How to configure/use

You can either use this module "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements. 

=== "Out-of-the-box"

To use "out-of-the-box":

* update your classpath by adding importing the parent module's dependency into in your parent module's `pom.xml`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
            <artifactId>isis-module-commchannel-dom</artifactId>
            <version>${isis-module-commchannel.version}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
        ...
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----


* if using `AppManifest`, then update its `getModules()` method:

    @Override
    public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
        return Arrays.asList(
                ...
                org.incode.module.commchannel.dom.CommChannelModule.class,
        );
    }


* alternatively, in your project's `webapp` module, update your `WEB-INF/isis.properties`. +
+
[source,xml]
----
  isis.services.ServicesInstallerFromAnnotation.packagePrefix=\
                                ...\
                                org.isisaddons.module.commchannel.dom,\
                                ...
----

Check for later releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|incode-module-commchannel-dom[Maven Central Repo].


==== "Out-of-the-box" (-SNAPSHOT)

If you want to use the current `-SNAPSHOT`, then the steps are the same as above, except:

* when updating the classpath, specify the appropriate -SNAPSHOT version:

[source,xml]
----
<version>1.10.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
----

* add the repository definition to pick up the most recent snapshot (we use the Cloudbees continuous integration service).  We suggest defining the repository in a `<profile>`:

[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>cloudbees-snapshots</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo<;/id>
            <url>http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false>/enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</profile>
----


=== For each domain object...

For each domain object that you want to be able to attach notes, you need to implement the `CommunicationChannelOwner`
marker interface and (optionally but strongly recommended) also implement a subclass of `CommunicationChannelOwnerLink`
to hold a type-safe reference back to the domain object.

For each such `CommunicationChannelOwner`, the module will then:

* contribute the `communicationChannels` collection

* contribute the `newPostalAddress` action

* contribute the `newEmailAddress` action

* contribute the `newPhoneOrFaxNumber` action

Other than implementing the marker interface, the `CommunicationChannelOwner` domain object will be completely decoupled
from the rest of the module.

In detail:

* have the domain object implement the `CommunicationChannelOwner` interface: +
+
For example, in the demo app the `CommChannelDemoObject` implements this interface: +
+
[source,java]
----
public class CommChannelDemoObject implements CommunicationChannelOwner {
    ...
}
----
+
This is a marker interface only (no methods need be implemented); it is used only so that Apache Isis knows where to
contribute the collections and actions.

* subclass the `CommunicationChannelOwnerLink` abstract class and also implement a domain event subscriber to correctly
instantiate the subclass. +
+
For example, in the demo app the `CommunicationChannelOwnerLinkForDemoObject` implements both of these responsibilities: +
+
[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable(
        schema="commchanneldemo")
@javax.jdo.annotations.Inheritance(
        strategy = InheritanceStrategy.NEW_TABLE)
@DomainObject(
        objectType = "commchanneldemo.CommunicationChannelOwnerLinkForDemoObject"
)
public class CommunicationChannelOwnerLinkForDemoObject extends CommunicationChannelOwnerLink { // <1>

    @DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
    @DomainServiceLayout(menuOrder = "1")
    public static class InstantiationSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {                    // <2>
        @Programmatic
        @Subscribe
        public void on(final InstantiateEvent ev) {
            if(ev.getPolymorphicReference() instanceof CommChannelDemoObject) {
                ev.setSubtype(CommunicationChannelOwnerLinkForDemoObject.class);
            }
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void setPolymorphicReference(final CommunicationChannelOwner polymorphicReference) { // <3>
        super.setPolymorphicReference(polymorphicReference);
        setDemoObject((CommChannelDemoObject) polymorphicReference);
    }

    private CommChannelDemoObject demoObject;
    @Column(
            allowsNull = "false",
            name = "demoObjectId"
    )
    public CommChannelDemoObject getDemoObject() {                                              // <4>
        return demoObject;
    }
    public void setDemoObject(final CommChannelDemoObject demoObject) {
        this.demoObject = demoObject;
    }
}
----
<1> extend from `CommunicationChannelOwnerLink`
<2> implementation of a domain event subscriber that tells the `incode-module-commchannel` which subclass of
`CommunicationChannelOwnerLink` to instantiate to handle the polymorphic link between `CommunicationChannel` and the
`CommunicationChannelOwner`.
<3> override the inherited `setPolymorphicReference(...)` method to allow the type-safe reference property to the
`CommunicationChannelOwner` (in this case `CommChannelDemoObject`) to be set
<4> the type-safe reference property to the `CommunicationChannelOwner` (in this case `CommunicationChannelDemoObject`).
In the RDBMS this will correspond to a regular foreign key with referential integrity constraints correctly applied.



=== SPI

The `CommunicationChannelPurposeRepository` interface can optionally be implemented to specify the available "purpose"
for each `CommunicationChannel` domain object.

For example, in the demo app this is implemented as:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class CommChannelDemoPurposeRepository implements CommunicationChannelPurposeRepository {
    @Override
    public Collection<String> purposesFor(
            final CommunicationChannelType communicationChannelType,
            final CommunicationChannelOwner communicationChannel) {
        switch (communicationChannelType) {
            case EMAIL_ADDRESS:
                return Arrays.asList("Home Email", "Work Email", "Other Email");
            case POSTAL_ADDRESS:
                return Arrays.asList("Billing Address", "Shipping Address");
            case PHONE_NUMBER:
                return Arrays.asList("Home Number", "Work Number", "Mobile Number");
            case FAX_NUMBER:
                return Arrays.asList("Home Fax", "Work Fax");
        }
        return null;
    }
}
----

If no implementation of this interface can be found, then the module provides a single "default" purpose for all
communication channels.


=== Suppressing/adding UI elements

Every property, collection and action has a corresponding domain event.  Thus, a subscriber can be used to hide or disable UI representation of any domain object's members.

For example, the "notes" property could be suppressed using the following service:

[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class CommChannelDemoSuppressNotesSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {
    @Subscribe
    public void on(CommunicationChannel.NotesDomainEvent ev) {
        switch (ev.getEventPhase()) {
        case HIDE:
            // uncomment as an example of how to influence the UI
            // (the notes property should disappear)
            // ev.hide();
        }
    }
}
----

Conversely, new UI elements can be added using link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ug.html#_ug_how-tos_contributed-members[contributions] and mixins.



== Other Services

The module provides the following domain services for querying notes:

* `CommunicationChannelRepository` +
+
To search for ``CommunicationChannel``s by owner and type.

* `CommunicationChannelOwnerLinkRepository` +
+
To search for `CommunicationChannelOwnerLink``s, ie the tuple that links a `CommunicationChannel` to an
arbitrary `CommunicationChannelOwner`.  This repository is likely to be less useful than `CommunicationChannelRepository`,
but is crucial to the internal workings of the `incode-module-commchannel` module.





== Related Modules/Services

The module implements the http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-gmap3[Isis addons' gmap3]'s
 `LocationDereferencingService` SPI, so that clicking on a marker on a map will render the `CommunicationChannelOwner`, rather than the details of the `CommunicationChannel` itself.

The module uses the design pattern of the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-poly[Isis addons' poly] module, to support type-safe polymorphic associations.



== Known issues

None at this time.


== Change Log

* `1.10.0-SNAPSHOT` - (to be) released against Isis 1.10.0 (when available).




=== Forking the repo

If instead you want to extend this module's functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo.  The repo is
structured as follows:

* `pom.xml   ` - parent pom
* `app`        - the demo webapp's `AppManifest`
* `dom       ` - the module implementation, depends on Isis applib
* `fixture   ` - fixtures, holding a sample domain objects and fixture scripts; depends on `dom`
* `integtests` - integration tests for the module; depends on `fixture`
* `webapp    ` - demo webapp (see above screenshots); depends on `dom` and `fixture`

Only the `dom` project is released to Maven Central Repo.  The versions of the other modules are purposely left at
`0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` because they are not intended to be released.

Note that the module uses link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok].  To compile the code within your IDE you will
therefore require the appropriate Lombok plugin.  See the link:https://projectlombok.org/download.html[Lombok download page] for more information.

=== Dependencies

There are no third-party dependencies.

==  Maven deploy notes

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

=== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd dom
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].



=== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.10.0 \
              1.11.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master
git push origin 1.10.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again.  Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the 
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo).  You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
