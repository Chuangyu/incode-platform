This module, intended for use within http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis], provides an implementation of the link:http://datanucleus.org/[DataNucleus] link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform_4_1/jdo/pmf.html[`PersistenceManagerFactory`] class.
This uses link:https://flywaydb.org[FlywayDB] API to automatically apply any database migration scripts prior to the bootstrapping of the rest of the Apache Isis runtime.



== How to run the Demo App

The prerequisite software is:

* Java JDK 7 or JDK 8
* http://maven.apache.org[maven 3] (3.3.x is recommended).

To build the demo app:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-flywaydb.git
mvn clean install
----

To run the demo app:

[source]
----
mvn -pl webapp jetty:run
----

The app will bootstrap against an in-memory database, however it will be FlywayDB that sets up the database schema (rather than DataNucleus automatically creating the database as might normally be the case).
This is discussed in a little more detail xref:what-happens-during-bootstrapping[below].

Then log on using user: `sven`, password: `pass`


[[what-happens-during-bootstrapping]]
== What happens during bootstrapping
:link-v1: link:https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-flywaydb/blob/master/webapp/src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__schema-simple.sql
:link-v2: link:https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-flywaydb/blob/master/webapp/src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__table-simple_SimpleObject.sql


When the application bootstraps, it uses the run two DB migration files that reside in `db.migration` package of the webapp module:

* {link-v1}[V1__schema-simple.sql] +
+
creates the `simple` schema

* {link-v2}[V2__table-simple_SimpleObject.sql] +
+
creates the `simple.SimpleObject` table to hold the `SimpleObject` entity.


As a side-effect of running the migration, the flyway DB schema management tables are created.


== How to Configure/Use

In the webapp's link:https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-flywaydb/blob/master/webapp/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/persistor_datanucleus.properties#L50[`persistor_datanucleus.properties`] file:

[source,properties]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.javax.jdo.PersistenceManagerFactoryClass=org.isisaddons.module.flywaydb.dom.FlywayJdoPersistenceManagerFactory
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll=false
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.schema.validateAll=true
----

Enabling DataNucleus' `validateAll` setting means you can be assured that your migration scripts have brought the database schema into the same shape as is expected by DataNucleus; if there is a mismatch then the app will fail to bootstrap.
See the section immediately xref:handling-validation-errors[below] for workarounds when validation errors are thrown that should not be.


[[handling-validation-errors]]
=== Handling Validation Errors

Sometimes `validateAll` can result in DataNucleus throwing an exception even if the actual database matches the schema.
The underlying reason for this occurring will vary; one reason is a buggy JDBC driver misreporting database metadata.
It is however possible to workaround this issue.

By way of example, when running against MS SQL Server you may find that BLOB/CLOB columns are reported as being invalid.
One common example is the `CommandJdo` entity (in the link:http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[Isis addons' command] module), with its `exception` and a `memento` properties.
This is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public class CommandJdo {
    ...
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull="true", jdbcType="CLOB")
    private String exception;
    ...
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull="true", jdbcType="CLOB")
    private String memento;
    ...
}
----

In MS SQL Server this is mapped to a table with a column of type `TEXT`.
However, this results in DataNucleus throwing an exception, to the effect that the datastore defines a LONGVARCHAR, while the (class) metadata defines a CLOB.

The workaround is to redefine the JDO metadata using an `.orm` file.
For example, `CommandJdo` can be made to work by adding `CommandJdo-sqlserver.orm`:

[source,java]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<orm xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/orm"
     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/orm
        http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/orm_3_0.xsd">

    <package name="org.isisaddons.module.command.dom">
        <class name="CommandJdo"
               schema="isiscommand"
               table="Command">
            <property name="exception">
                <column name="exception" jdbc-type="CLOB" sql-type="LONGVARCHAR" allows-null="true"/>
            </property>
            <field name="memento">
                <column name="memento" jdbc-type="CLOB" sql-type="LONGVARCHAR" allows-null="true"/>
            </field>
        </class>
    </package>

</orm>
----

This should reside in the appropriate package (`org.isisaddons.module.command.dom` in this case).

Another example is the `DocumentAbstract` entity (in the link:http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-document[Incode catalogs' document] module), with its `blob_byte` and a `memento` properties.

[source,java]
----
public class DocumentAbstract {
    ...
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull = "true", name = "blob_bytes", jdbcType = "BLOB", sqlType = "BLOB")
    private byte[] blobBytes;
    ...
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull = "true", name = "clob_chars", jdbcType = "CLOB", sqlType = "CLOB")
    private String clobChars;
    ...
}
----

The fix in this case is the following `DocumentAbstract-sqlserver.orm` file:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<orm xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/orm"
     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/orm
        http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/orm_3_0.xsd">

    <package name="org.incode.module.document.dom.impl.docs">
        <class name="DocumentAbstract"
               schema="incodeDocuments">
            <field name="blobBytes">
                <column name="blob_bytes" jdbc-type="BLOB" sql-type="LONGVARBINARY" allows-null="true"/>
            </field>
            <field name="clobChars">
                <column name="clob_chars" jdbc-type="CLOB" sql-type="LONGVARCHAR" allows-null="true"/>
            </field>
        </class>
    </package>
</orm>
----

The last thing to do is to instruct DataNucleus to also read these additional `.orm` files.
This can be done using:

[source,properties]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.Mapping=sqlserver
----

where `sqlserver` matches the filename (`DocumentAbstract-*sqlserver*.orm` and so on).


=== Disabling for Development

When developing Apache Isis applications, it's common practice to prototype and run integration tests in memory, by default using HSQLDB.
In production, however, some other database will most likely be used (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server etc).

Now FlywayDB - by design - does not attempt to abstract over different database vendors.
In other words, the SQL migration scripts that are designed for production will quite possibly not work for development environment.
The long and short of this is that you will most likely want to simply disable the flyway migration when running in-memory against HSQLDB.

This can be done simply by setting the `autoCreateAll` property back to `true`, either in the `persistor_datanucleus.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll=true
----

or, (if using `mvn jetty:run` or `org.apache.isis.WebServer`) using a system property, eg:

[source,properties]
----
mvn jetty:run -Disis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll=true
----

==== Dependencies

There are no third-party dependencies.

== Maven deploy notes

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

==== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd dom
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].


=== Release an Interim Build

If you have commit access to this project (or a fork of your own) then you can create interim releases using the `interim-release.sh` script.

The idea is that this will - in a new branch - update the `dom/pom.xml` with a timestamped version (eg `1.13.0.20161017-0738`).
It then pushes the branch (and a tag) to the specified remote.

A CI server such as Jenkins can monitor the branches matching the wildcard `origin/interim/*` and create a build.
These artifacts can then be published to a snapshot repository.

For example:

[source]
----
sh interim-release.sh 1.13.0 origin
----

where

* `1.13.0` is the base release
* `origin` is the name of the remote to which you have permissions to write to.




==== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.13.0 \
              1.14.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master
git push origin 1.13.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again. Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo). You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
