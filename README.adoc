This module, intended for use within http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis], provides an implementation of the link:http://datanucleus.org/[DataNucleus] link:http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform_4_1/jdo/pmf.html[`PersistenceManagerFactory`] class.
This uses link:https://flywaydb.org[FlywayDB] API to automatically apply any database migration scripts prior to the bootstrapping of the rest of the Apache Isis runtime.



== How to run the Demo App

The prerequisite software is:

* Java JDK 7 or JDK 8
* http://maven.apache.org[maven 3] (3.3.x is recommended).

To build the demo app:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-flywaydb.git
mvn clean install
----

To run the demo app:

[source]
----
mvn -pl webapp jetty:run
----

The app will bootstrap against an in-memory database, however it will be FlywayDB that sets up the database schema (rather than DataNucleus automatically creating the database as might normally be the case).
This is discussed in a little more detail xref:what-happens-during-bootstrapping[below].

Then log on using user: `sven`, password: `pass`




[[what-happens-during-bootstrapping]]
== What happens during bootstrapping
:link-v1: link:webapp/src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__schema-simple.sql
:link-v2: link:webapp/src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__table-simple_SimpleObject.sql


When the application bootstraps, it uses the run two DB migration files that reside in `db.migration` package of the webapp module:

* {link-v1}[V1__schema-simple.sql] +
+
creates the `simple` schema

* {link-v2}[V2__table-simple_SimpleObject.sql] +
+
creates the `simple.SimpleObject` table to hold the `SimpleObject` entity.

As a side-effect of running the migration, the flyway DB schema management tables are created.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While (for simplicity) the demo application uses files named `V1\__`, `V2__` and so on, we recommend you use a more sophisticated naming convention based on dates.
See xref:naming-convention-for-scripts[below] for further discussion.
====


All of this can be confirmed by invoking `Prototyping > HSQL DB Manager` to spawn off a Swing UI client that can view the (in-memory) database:

image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isisaddons/isis-module-flywaydb/master/images/hsqldb.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isisaddons/isis-module-flywaydb/master/images/hsqldb.png"]

This shows the migration scripts have been run, and the FlywayDB schema tables created and populated.



== How to Configure

To configure:

* update your classpath by adding this dependency in your project's `webapp` module's `pom.xml`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.isisaddons.module.flywaydb</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-module-flywaydb-dom</artifactId>
    <version>1.13.0</version>
</dependency>
----

* In the ``webapp``'s ``persistor_datanucleus.properties`` file, set: +
+
[source,properties]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.javax.jdo.PersistenceManagerFactoryClass=org.isisaddons.module.flywaydb.dom.FlywayJdoPersistenceManagerFactory
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll=false
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.schema.validateAll=true
----

Enabling DataNucleus' `validateAll` setting means you can be assured that your migration scripts have brought the database schema into the same shape as is expected by DataNucleus; if there is a mismatch then the app will fail to bootstrap.

[TIP]
====
See the section xref:handling-validation-errors[below] for workarounds when validation errors are thrown that should not be.
====




== How to Use

The sections below describe some of the common use cases.



=== Disabling for Development

When developing Apache Isis applications, it's common practice to prototype and run integration tests in memory, by default using HSQLDB.
In production, however, some other database will most likely be used (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MS SQL Server etc).

Now FlywayDB - by design - does not attempt to abstract over different database vendors.
In other words, the SQL migration scripts that are designed for production will quite possibly not work for development environment.
The long and short of this is that you will most likely want to simply disable the flyway migration when running in-memory against HSQLDB.

This can be done simply by setting the `autoCreateAll` property back to `true`, either in the `persistor_datanucleus.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll=true
----

or, (if using `mvn jetty:run` or `org.apache.isis.WebServer`) using a system property, eg:

[source,properties]
----
mvn jetty:run -Disis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll=true
----


[[naming-convention-for-scripts]]
=== Naming convention for scripts

TODO: discuss why should use `` instead of `V1__` etc

When FlywayDB runs it searches for files named `Vnnnn\__`, where `nnnn` is some number.
In the FlywayDB documentation (and, for that matter, in the demo app for this module), those numbers start at 1.
However, if your team uses link:http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureBranch.html[feature branch]es then this is likely to cause conflicts when those feature branches are merged back into master/trunk.

Luckily, FlywayDB does not require the version numbers to be contiguous.
Therefore, (along link:http://www.jeremyjarrell.com/using-flyway-db-with-distributed-version-control/[with] link:http://stackoverflow.com/a/34599349/56880[others]) we recommend that the number used is the current date/time, for example:

[source]
----
VyyyyMMddhhmm__description-of-the-change.sql
----

When the feature branches are merged, you (the developer) should check that any new migrations have a later timestamp than the version of the current production database; chances are they will be.
But if necessary, the filename/timestamp can be updated, eg to be the current date/time that the merged is performed.

[IMPORTANT]
====
While FlywayDB itself _does_ support link:https://flywaydb.org/documentation/commandline/migrate["outOfOrder"] migrations (ie to run a migration whose number is less than that of the current production database), this module's integration with the FlywayDB API does _not_ support that feature.

If you do require outOfOrder migrations, then the DBA can always run the FlywayDB command line tool.
====



[[baselining-an-existing-database]]
=== Baselining an existing database

If you want to start using FlywayDB for with an existing database that is already in production, then it must be  link:https://flywaydb.org/documentation/command/baseline[baseline]d.
This involves:

* generate scripts to represent the current state of the database.
** for example, if using MS SQL Server then use the link:https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/bb895179(v=sql.110).aspx[Generate and Publish Scripts] wizard (Tasks > Generate Scripts)
* save these as `VyyyyMMddhhmm__initial-take-on.sql` +
+
Following the date/time naming convention discussed xref:naming-convention-for-scripts[above].

* run the `baseline` command: +
+
[source,bash]
----
flyway -driver=... \
       -url=... \
       -user=... \
       -password=... \
       -baselineVersion=yyyyMMddhhmm \                  #1
       -baselineDescription="Initial take-on" \
       -jarDirs=... \
       baseline
----
<1> the version number of the initial take-on script, above
+
It's also possible to specify command-line options using a `flyway.conf` link:https://flywaydb.org/documentation/commandline/[configuration file].

This will result in the FlywayDB schema tables being generated and a row inserted indicating that the schema represents the specified baseline versions.
Thereafter FlywayDB will only perform migrations for numbers higher than this baseline.


[[process-for-creating-migration-scripts]]
=== A Process for creating migration scripts

Suppose you've developed a new feature which will require a database schema change; how should the migration scripts be created and tested?
Here's one process:

* obtain a backup of the current production database (which is already under FlywayDB's control; xref:baselining-an-existing-database[baseline] it if not) +
+
In fact, all that is required is the schema of this database.
So, as a minor refinement, you could set up a CI pipeline that hooks onto your nightly database backups; this would restore the production database to some scratch DB, then truncate all tables, then creates a backup of that truncated database.
See link:/util/sql/truncate-all-tables.sql[truncate-all-tables.sql] for a script that does this for MS SQL Server.

* in your development environment, restore two copies of the current production database twice (or truncated version):
** restore once to `current` DB
** restore another to `test` DB

* create a completely blank `dev` DB +
+
See link:/util/sql/drop-all-tables.sql[drop-all-tables.sql] for a script that does this for MS SQL Server.

* run app against this empty `dev` database, with `autoCreateAll=true` +
+
This disables FlywayDB, causing DataNucleus to create the schema based on its current metadata

* next, use a comparison tool to compare `current` against `dev`. +
+
One option is to use the command line tools provided by link:http://www.liquibase.org/[liquibase], a rather more sophisticated migration tool.
See xref:using-liquibase-to-diff-databases[below] for details of how to use liquibase's commandline tool.

* Save SQL scripts capturing the difference

* Finally, run app against `test` DB, this time with `autoCreateAll=false` (and `validateAll=true`)
** `autoCreateAll=true` re-enables FlywayDB, causing it apply the migration scripts
** `validateAll=true` causes DataNucleus to check that the resultant DB schema matches that required by the entity metadata.
** If there is an issue then the app will fails to start; use the errors in the console to diagnose the issue and then go round the loop.


[[using-liquibase-to-diff-databases]]
=== Using Liquibase to diff databases

Liquibase is another Java-based migration tool which some prefer though its scope is rather more advanced compared to FlywayDB.
What it _does_ also provide that is useful is a command line tool that can be used to diff databases.

TODO: complete this...


[[handling-validation-errors]]
=== Handling Validation Errors

Sometimes `validateAll` can result in DataNucleus throwing an exception even if the actual database matches the schema.
The underlying reason for this occurring will vary; one reason is a buggy JDBC driver misreporting database metadata.
It is however possible to workaround this issue.

By way of example, when running against MS SQL Server you may find that BLOB/CLOB columns are reported as being invalid.
One common example is the `CommandJdo` entity (in the link:http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-command[Isis addons' command] module), with its `exception` and a `memento` properties.
This is defined as:

[source,java]
----
public class CommandJdo {
    ...
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull="true", jdbcType="CLOB")
    private String exception;
    ...
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull="true", jdbcType="CLOB")
    private String memento;
    ...
}
----

In MS SQL Server this is mapped to a table with a column of type `TEXT`.
However, this results in DataNucleus throwing an exception, to the effect that the datastore defines a LONGVARCHAR, while the (class) metadata defines a CLOB.

The workaround is to redefine the JDO metadata using an `.orm` file.
For example, `CommandJdo` can be made to work by adding `CommandJdo-sqlserver.orm`:

[source,java]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<orm xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/orm"
     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/orm
        http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/orm_3_0.xsd">

    <package name="org.isisaddons.module.command.dom">
        <class name="CommandJdo"
               schema="isiscommand"
               table="Command">
            <property name="exception">
                <column name="exception" jdbc-type="CLOB" sql-type="LONGVARCHAR" allows-null="true"/>
            </property>
            <field name="memento">
                <column name="memento" jdbc-type="CLOB" sql-type="LONGVARCHAR" allows-null="true"/>
            </field>
        </class>
    </package>

</orm>
----

This should reside in the appropriate package (`org.isisaddons.module.command.dom` in this case).

Another example is the `DocumentAbstract` entity (in the link:http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-document[Incode catalogs' document] module), with its `blob_byte` and a `memento` properties.

[source,java]
----
public class DocumentAbstract {
    ...
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull = "true", name = "blob_bytes", jdbcType = "BLOB", sqlType = "BLOB")
    private byte[] blobBytes;
    ...
    @javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull = "true", name = "clob_chars", jdbcType = "CLOB", sqlType = "CLOB")
    private String clobChars;
    ...
}
----

The fix in this case is the following `DocumentAbstract-sqlserver.orm` file:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<orm xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/orm"
     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/orm
        http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/jdo/orm_3_0.xsd">

    <package name="org.incode.module.document.dom.impl.docs">
        <class name="DocumentAbstract"
               schema="incodeDocuments">
            <field name="blobBytes">
                <column name="blob_bytes" jdbc-type="BLOB" sql-type="LONGVARBINARY" allows-null="true"/>
            </field>
            <field name="clobChars">
                <column name="clob_chars" jdbc-type="CLOB" sql-type="LONGVARCHAR" allows-null="true"/>
            </field>
        </class>
    </package>
</orm>
----

The last thing to do is to instruct DataNucleus to also read these additional `.orm` files.
This can be done using:

[source,properties]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.Mapping=sqlserver
----

where `sqlserver` matches the filename (`DocumentAbstract-*sqlserver*.orm` and so on).

==== Dependencies

There are no third-party dependencies.

== Maven deploy notes

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

==== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd dom
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].


=== Release an Interim Build

If you have commit access to this project (or a fork of your own) then you can create interim releases using the `interim-release.sh` script.

The idea is that this will - in a new branch - update the `dom/pom.xml` with a timestamped version (eg `1.13.0.20161017-0738`).
It then pushes the branch (and a tag) to the specified remote.

A CI server such as Jenkins can monitor the branches matching the wildcard `origin/interim/*` and create a build.
These artifacts can then be published to a snapshot repository.

For example:

[source]
----
sh interim-release.sh 1.13.0 origin
----

where

* `1.13.0` is the base release
* `origin` is the name of the remote to which you have permissions to write to.




==== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.13.0 \
              1.14.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master
git push origin 1.13.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again. Note that in the ``dom``'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo). You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
