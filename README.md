Add this component to your classpath, eg:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.danhaywood.isis.wicket.ui.components</groupId>
        <artifactId>danhaywood-isis-wicket-gmap2</artifactId>
        <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>


You should then find that any collections of entities that have date properties (either returned from an action, or as a parented collection) will be rendered in a calendar.
