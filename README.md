# isis-module-security #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/isisaddons/isis-module-security.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/isisaddons/isis-module-security)

This module, intended for use within [Apache Isis](http://isis.apache.org), provides the ability to manage *user*s, *role*s,
and *permission*s.  Users have roles, roles have permissions, and permissions are associated with *application feature*s. 
These features are derived from the Isis metamodel and can be scoped at either a _package_, _class_ or individual _class member_.
Permissions themselves can either _allow_ or _veto_ the ability to _view_ or _change_ any application feature.

A key design objective of this module has been to limit the amount of permissioning data required.  To this objective:

* permissions are hierarchical: a class-level permission applies to all class members, while a package-level permission 
  applies to all classes of all subpackages
  
* permissions can ALLOW or VETO access; thus a role can be granted access to most features, but excluded from selective others

* permissions are scoped: a member-level permission overrides a class-level permission, a class-level permission 
  overrides a package-level permission; the lower-level package permission overrides a higher-level one 
  (eg `com.mycompany.invoicing` overrides `com.mycompany`).

* if there are conflicting permissions at the same scope, then the ALLOW takes precedence over the VETO.
  
The module also provides an implementation of [Apache Shiro](http://shiro.apache.org)'s 
[AuthorizingRealm](https://shiro.apache.org/static/1.2.2/apidocs/org/apache/shiro/realm/AuthorizingRealm.html).  This 
allows the users/permissions to be used for Isis' authentication and/or authorization.  If using for authentication,
passwords are encrypted using a `PasswordEncryptionService`.  The module provides a default implementation based on
[jBCrypt](http://www.mindrot.org/projects/jBCrypt/), but will other implementations can be plugged-in if required.
  
## Domain Model ##

The above diagram was generated by [yuml.me](http://yuml.me); see appendix at end of page for the DSL.

## Screenshots ##

The following screenshots show an example app's usage of the module, which includes all the services and entities 
([users, roles, permissions](https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/tree/master/dom/src/main/java/org/isisaddons/module/security/dom) etc) 
provided by the module itself.  This example app's [domain](https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/tree/master/fixture/src/main/java/org/isisaddons/module/security/fixture/dom) 
also has its own very simple `ExampleEntity` entity and corresponding repository.

#### Application Menus ####

The security module provides a number of menus: _Users_, _Roles_, _Features_, _Permissions_ and _User Tenancies_:

#### Installing example fixture data ####

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/020-install-fixtures.png)

#### Application Role ####

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/030-role.png)

#### Add permission for all features in a package ####

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/040-role-add-permission-package.png)

#### Permissions can ALLOW or VETO access ####

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/050-permission-rule.png)

#### Permissions can apply to VIEWING or CHANGING the feature ####

For a property, "changing" means being able to edit it.  For a collection, "changing" means being able to add or remove
from it.  For an action, "changing" means being able to invoke it.

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/060-permission-mode.png)

Note that Isis' Wicket viewer currently does not support the concept of "changing" collections; the work-around is 
instead create a pair of actions to add/remove instead.  This level of control is usually needed anyway.

#### Specify package ####

The list of packages is derived from Isis' own metamodel.

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/070-permission-package-from-isis-metamodel.png)

#### Permission added ####

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/080-permission-added.png)

#### Add permission for all members in a class ####

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/090-role-add-permission-class.png)

Select classes within package:

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/100-role-add-permission-class-in-package.png)

#### Add permission to an individual property of a class ####

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/110-role-add-permission-property.png)

Package list is filtered to those that contain classes that have properties:

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/120-role-add-property-filtered-packages.png)

Select property:

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/130-role-add-permission-property.png)

#### Add permission to an individual collection ####

Works similarly to adding a property; the package list is filtered to those classes that actually have collections.

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/150-role-add-collection-permission.png)

#### Add permission to an individual action ####

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/170-role-add-permission-action.png)

#### Using rules to fine-tune permissions ####

A VETO CHANGING rule prevents the action from being invoked.

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/180-using-rules-and-modes-to-finetune.png)

#### Permissions can also be removed ####

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/220-remove-permission.png)

To remove, specify the permission's rule, type and feature:

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/230-remove-permission-available.png)

#### Add user to a role ####

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/240-role-add-user.png)

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/250-role-add-user-autoComplete.png)

#### Can navigate from role ... ####

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/260-role-permission.png)

#### ... to role's permission ####

Permission simply holds the role, rule, mode and feature.  The role, rule and mode can be changed.  The feature cannot
be changed, but _can_ be navigated to...

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/270-permission.png)

#### Application feature for a class member ####

... lists the associated permissions, and provides access to the parent (class) feature...

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/280-feature.png)

#### Application feature for a class ####

The class feature lists associated permissions (if any), also the child properties, collections and actions.  It also 
provides access to its parent (package) feature ...

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/283-class-feature.png)

#### Application feature for a package ####

The package feature lists its associated permissions (if any), its contents (class or package features) and also 
provides access to its parent (package) feature.

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/286-package-feature.png)

#### Application users ####

The minimum information held for users its just the `username`; this corresponds to the name used to log in to Isis via
Shiro.  Additional information can also be stored, for example their full name.

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/290-user-update-name.png)

#### Entering a user's full name ####

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/300-user-name.png)

#### User tenancy ####

Each user can have an associated tenancy, so for example an Italian user sees only Italian data.  
(This anticipates support for multi-tenancy within Isis itself, not yet implemented as of 1.6.0).

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/310-user-name-updated.png)

Changing tenancy for a user:

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/320-user-update-tenancy.png)

#### User permissions ####

The effective permissions for each user are listed.  This evaluates the roles that the user is in, the permissions
of those roles, including all scoping and ALLOW|VETO rules.

In the screenshot below, "joe" has access to all features because he has the "admin" role:

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/325-user-permission.png)

#### User role maintenance ####

The user's roles can be maintained through the user entity as well as the role entity (above).

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/330-user-add-remove-roles.png)

For example, remove the "admin" role from "joe":

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/340-user-remove-role.png)

#### Effective permissions updated ####

Whenever role membership is changed, the effective permissions for a user are re-evaluated.

In the screenshot below, note that "joe" no longer has access to most features:

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/350-user-effective-permissions-updated.png)

... though those permissions associated with the "readOnly" role are still effective:

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-security/master/images/360-user-effective-permissions.png)

#### User permission ####

Finally, the user permission not only shows whether a user has a permission to a feature, but also indicates the 
role permission that is allowing/vetoing the ability to view or change the feature.

Cool huh?


## How to configure/use ##

*TODO: this is incomplete.  It also needs to be extended to include Shiro configuration*

You can either use this module "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements. 

To use "out-of-the-box":

* update your classpath by adding this dependency in your dom project's `pom.xml`:

<pre>
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.isisaddons.module.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;isis-module-security-dom&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;1.6.0&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>

* update your `WEB-INF/isis.properties`:

<pre>
    isis.services-installer=configuration-and-annotation
    isis.services.ServicesInstallerFromAnnotation.packagePrefix=
                    ...,\
                    org.isisaddons.module.xxx.xxx,\
                    ...

    isis.services = ...,\
                    org.isisaddons.module.xxx.XxxContributions,\
                    ...
</pre>

Notes:
* Check for later releases by searching [Maven Central Repo](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|isis-module-security-dom).
* The `XxxContributions` service is optional but recommended; see below for more information.

If instead you want to extend this module's functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo.  The repo is 
structured as follows:

* `pom.xml   ` - parent pom
* `dom       ` - the module implementation, depends on Isis applib
* `fixture   ` - fixtures, holding a sample domain objects and fixture scripts; depends on `dom`
* `integtests` - integration tests for the module; depends on `fixture`
* `webapp    ` - demo webapp (see above screenshots); depends on `dom` and `fixture`

Only the `dom` project is released to Maven Central Repo.  The versions of the other modules are purposely left at 
`0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` because they are not intended to be released.

## API and Implementation ##

*TODO: this is incomplete.  Need to document how to customise, eg MeService, PasswordEncryptionService and the menu services in order to 
have full control over the UI.*

### XxxService ###

The `XxxService` defines the following API:

<pre>
public interface XxxService {
}
</pre>


## Future Directions/Possible Improvements ##

The module currently does not support:
- setting permissions on the root package.  Instead, must specify for `org` or `com` top-level package.  This means that
  the edge case of permissions for a class in the root package is not supported.
- users could possibly be extended to include user settings, refactored out from [isis-module-settings](https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-settings)
- features could possibly be refactored out/merged with [isis-module-devutils](https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-devutils).

#### Dependencies ####

*TODO: incomplete; expect to take a dependency on [jBcrypt](http://www.mindrot.org/projects/jBCrypt/) in order to perform
secure password encryption*



##  Maven deploy notes ##

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see 
[user guide](http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html)).

#### Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo ####

To deploy a snapshot, use:

    pushd dom
    mvn clean deploy
    popd

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's 
[Snapshot Repo](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots).

#### Release to Maven Central (scripted process) ####

The `release.sh` script automates the release process.  It performs the following:

* perform sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bump the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* perform a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* release the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bump the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

    sh release.sh 1.6.1 \
                  1.6.2-SNAPSHOT \
                  dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
                  "this is not really my passphrase"
    
where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

    git push
    
If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again.

#### Release to Maven Central (manual process) ####

If you don't want to use `release.sh`, then the steps can be performed manually.

To start, call `bumpver.sh` to bump up to the release version, eg:

     `sh bumpver.sh 1.6.1`

which:
* edit the parent `pom.xml`, to change `${isis-module-command.version}` to version
* edit the `dom` module's pom.xml version
* commit the changes
* if a SNAPSHOT, then tag

Next, do a quick sanity check:

    mvn clean install -o
    
All being well, then release from the `dom` module:

    pushd dom
    mvn clean deploy -P release \
        -Dpgp.secretkey=keyring:id=dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
        -Dpgp.passphrase="literal:this is not really my passphrase"
    popd

where (for example):
* "dan@haywood-associates.co.uk" is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* the pass phrase is as specified as a literal

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s 
[documentation](http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html)).

If (in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the `autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true`,
then the above command will automatically stage, close and the release the repo.  Sync'ing to Maven Central should 
happen automatically.  According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update 
[search](http://search.maven.org).

If instead the `autoReleaseAfterClose` setting is set to `false`, then the repo will require manually closing and 
releasing either by logging onto the [Sonatype's OSS staging repo](https://oss.sonatype.org) or alternatively by 
releasing from the command line using `mvn nexus-staging:release`.

Finally, don't forget to update the release to next snapshot, eg:

    sh bumpver.sh 1.6.2-SNAPSHOT

and then push changes.
