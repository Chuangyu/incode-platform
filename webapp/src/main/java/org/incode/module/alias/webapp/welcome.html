<p class="intro">
    <a href="http://isis.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Isis</a>&trade; is a platform to let you rapidly develop
    domain-driven apps in Java.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This example app demonstrates the Incode' <a href="https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-alias" target="_blank">Alias Module</a>,
    configured for a very simple and purposefully minimal application.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The application demonstrates the ability to associate <code>Alias</code>es to any (arbitrary) domain object.
    Each alias is qualified by both an <code>AliasType</code> (eg to represent some external system such as
    <i>General Ledger</i> or <i>Document Management</i>) and also an application tenancy path (eg to support
    multi-tenancy, eg across countries).  The consuming application is required to implement mandatory SPI repositories
    for these two qualifiers.
    <br>
    <br>
    The module depends on the <a href="https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-poly" target="_blank">poly module</a> (polymorphic association pattern)</a>.  For more details, see the <a href="https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-alias" target="_blank">github repo</a>.
