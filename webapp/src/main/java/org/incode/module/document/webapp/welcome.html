<p class="intro">
    <a href="http://isis.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Isis</a>&trade; is a platform to let you rapidly develop
    domain-driven apps in Java.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This example app demonstrates the Incode <a href="https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-document" target="_blank">Document Module</a>,
    configured for a very simple and purposefully minimal application.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The application demonstrates the ability to preview or to create and attach <code>Document</code>s to any
    (arbitrary) domain object, assuming that there is a <code>DocumentTemplate</code> available that will consume the
    content of the input domain object to create the resultant <code>Document</code>.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The actual rendering of the <code>Document</code> is pluggable using the <code>Renderer</code> interface.
    <br/>
