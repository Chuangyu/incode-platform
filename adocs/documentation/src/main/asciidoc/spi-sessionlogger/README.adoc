This module, intended for use within http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis], provides an implementation of Isis'
`SessionLoggingService` API that persists audit entries using Isis' own (JDO) objectstore. Typically this will be to a
relational database; the module's `SessionLogEntry` entity is mapped to the "IsisSessionLogEntry" table.


== Screenshots

The sessionlogger module automatically creates log entries whenever a user logs on or logs out. The currently logged on users of the application (that is: those for whom there is a valid non-expired HTTP session) can be found from the activity menu:

In the screenshot below there are two currently active users:

The module also allows current and previously active sessions to be searched for:

The list of sessions can optionally be filtered by user and date range:

returning matching sessions:

== How to run the Demo App

The prerequisite software is:

* Java JDK 8 (>= 1.9.0) or Java JDK 7 (>= 1.8.0)
** note that the compile source and target remains at JDK 7
* http://maven.apache.org[maven 3] (3.2.x is recommended).

To build the demo app:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-audit.git
mvn clean install
----

To run the demo app:

[source,bash]
----
cd webapp
mvn jetty:run
----

Then log on using user: `sven`, password: `pass`



== How to Configure/Use

You can either use this module "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements. 

=== "Out-of-the-box"

To use "out-of-the-box":

* update your classpath by adding this dependency in your project's `dom` module's `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.isisaddons.module.sessionlogger</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-module-sessionlogger-dom</artifactId>
    <version>1.14.0</version>
</dependency>
----

Remaining steps to configure:

* if using `AppManifest`, then update its `getModules()` method: +
+
[source,java]
----
@Override
public List&lt;Class&lt;?&gt;&gt; getModules() {
    return Arrays.asList(
        ...
        org.isisaddons.module.sessionlogger.SessionLoggerModule.class,
        ...
    );
}
----

* otherwise, update your `WEB-INF/isis.properties`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
isis.services-installer=configuration-and-annotation
isis.services.ServicesInstallerFromAnnotation.packagePrefix=\
                ...,\
                org.isisaddons.module.sessionlogger.dom,\
                ...
----

Notes:

* Check for releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|isis-module-sessionlogger-dom[Maven Central Repo].

* The `SessionLoggingServiceMenu` service is optional but recommended; see below for more information.



=== "Out-of-the-box" (-SNAPSHOT)

If you want to use the current `-SNAPSHOT`, then the steps are the same as above, except:

* when updating the classpath, specify the appropriate -SNAPSHOT version: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<version>1.15.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
----

* add the repository definition to pick up the most recent snapshot (we use the Cloudbees continuous integration service). We suggest defining the repository in a `<profile>`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>cloudbees-snapshots</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo</id>
            <url>http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</profile>
----



=== Forking the repo

If instead you want to extend this module's functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo. The repo is
structured as follows:

* `pom.xml` - parent pom
* `dom` - the module implementation, depends on Isis applib
* `fixture` - fixtures, holding a sample domain objects and fixture scripts; depends on `dom`
* `integtests` - integration tests for the module; depends on `fixture`
* `webapp` - demo webapp (see above screenshots); depends on `dom` and `fixture`

Only the `dom` project is released to Maven Central Repo. The versions of the other modules are purposely left at
`0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` because they are not intended to be released.

== API

The `SessionLoggingService` defines the following API:

[source,java]
----
public interface SessionLoggingService {
    public enum Type {
        LOGIN,
        LOGOUT
    }
    public enum CausedBy {
        USER,
        SESSION_EXPIRATION,
        RESTART
    }
    void log(Type type, String username, Date date, CausedBy causedBy);
}
----

The framework will automatically call the `log(...)` method on the service implementation if configured to run the Wicket viewer.

[NOTE]
====
The framework only ever calls `log(...)` with a `CausedBy` value of either "USER" (the user has explicitly logged in
or logged out), or with "SESSION_EXPIRATION" (the Wicket viewer session has timed out).

The "RESTART" value is provided for implementations (such as the (non-ASF)
http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-sessionlogger[Isis addons' sessionlogger] module) which automatically "tidy-up"
and mark as complete and sessions that were in-progress if the webserver is restarted.
====



== Implementation

The `SessionLoggingService` API is implemented in this module by the `org.isisaddons.module.sessionlogger.SessionLoggingServiceDefault` class.
This implementation simply inserts a session log entry (`SessionLogEntry`) when either a user logs on, logs out or if
their session expires.

The `SessionLogEntry` properties directly correspond to parameters of the `SessionLoggingService` `log()` API:

[source,java]
----
public class SessionLogEntry
    ...
    private String sessionId;                           // <1>
    private String username;                            // <2>
    private SessionLoggingService.Type type;            // <3>
    private Timestamp loginTimestamp;                   // <4>
    private Timestamp logoutTimestamp;                  // <5>
    private SessionLoggingService.CausedBy causedBy;    // <6>
    ...
}
----
<1> `sessionId` identifies the user's session. Primary key. (*Note*: it is not the http session id!)
<2> `username` identifies the user that has logged in/out
<3> `type` determines whether this was a login or logout.
<4> `loginTimestamp` is the date that the login of the session event occurred
<5> `logoutTimestamp` is the date that the logout of the session event occurred
<6> `causedBy`indicates whether the session was logged out due to explicit user action, by session expiry, or by the server restarting

The `SessionLogEntry` entity is designed such that it can be rendered on an Isis user interface if required.



== Supporting Services

As well as the `SessionLoggingServiceDefault` service (that implements the `SessionLoggingService` API), the module
also provides two further domain services:

* `SessionLogEntryRepository` provides the ability to search for persisted (`SessionLogEntry`) entries. None of its
 actions are visible in the user interface (they are all `@Programmatic`) and so this service is automatically
 registered.

* `SessionLoggingServiceMenu` provides the secondary "Activity" menu for listing all active sessions and for searching for session entries by user and by date.

The `SessionLoggingServiceMenu` is automatically registered as a domain service; as such its actions will appear in the
user interface. If this is not required, then either use security permissions or write a vetoing subscriber on the
event bus to hide this functionality, eg:


[source,java]
----
@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
public class HideIsisAddonsSessionLoggerFunctionality extends AbstractSubscriber {
    @Subscribe
    public void on(final SessionLoggerModule.ActionDomainEvent<?> event) { event.hide(); }
}
----



== Related Modules/Services

There is some overlap with the`AuditingService3` API, which audits changes to entities by end-users. Implementations
of this service are referenced by the http://www.isisaddons.org[Isis Add-ons] website.


== Known issues or Limitations

The Restful Objects viewer currently does not support this service.

=== Dependencies

There are no third-party dependencies, however it does use icons from link:http://icons8.com[icons8.com].



== Maven deploy notes

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

=== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd dom
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].



=== Release an Interim Build

If you have commit access to this project (or a fork of your own) then you can create interim releases using the `interim-release.sh` script.

The idea is that this will - in a new branch - update the `dom/pom.xml` with a timestamped version (eg `1.14.0.20170227-0738`).
It then pushes the branch (and a tag) to the specified remote.

A CI server such as Jenkins can monitor the branches matching the wildcard `origin/interim/*` and create a build.
These artifacts can then be published to a snapshot repository.

For example:

[source]
----
sh interim-release.sh 1.14.0 origin
----

where

* `1.15.0` is the base release
* `origin` is the name of the remote to which you have permissions to write to.




==== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.14.0 \
              1.15.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master && git push origin 1.14.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again. Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo). You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
