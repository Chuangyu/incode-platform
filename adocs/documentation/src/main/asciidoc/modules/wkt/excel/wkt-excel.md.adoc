= Excel Wicket Component
:_basedir: ../../../
:_imagesdir: images/


This component (`isis-wicket-excel`) allows a collection of entities to be downloaded as an Excel spreadsheet (using [Apache POI](http://poi.apache.org)).

See also the [Isis Addons Excel module](https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-excel), which allows programmatic 
export and import, eg to support bulk updating/inserting.


== Screenshots

The module contributes an additional "view" for both standalone and parented collections:

For example, assuming some fixtures have been installed:

Then the standalone collection of all incomplete todo items shows
an additional link to select the excel view:

In both cases this view is simply a button to download the collection as an Excel spreadsheet:

And the spreadsheet contains the contents of the collection:

== How to configure/use


Simply add this component to your classpath, eg:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.isisaddons.wicket.excel</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-wicket-excel-cpt</artifactId>
    <version>1.15.0</version>
</dependency>
----

You should then find that a new view is provided for all collections of entities (either as returned from an action,
or as a parented collection), from which a link to download the spreadsheet can be accessed.  Check for later releases
by searching [Maven Central Repo](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|isis-wicket-excel-cpt).
