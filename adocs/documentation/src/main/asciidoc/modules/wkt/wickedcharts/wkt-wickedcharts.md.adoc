= WickedCharts Wicket Component
:_basedir: ../../../
:_imagesdir: images/


This component (`isis-wicket-wickedcharts`) integrates [Wicked Charts](https://code.google.com/p/wicked-charts/).
*Wicked Charts* is in turn an integration between [Apache Wicket](http://wicket.apache.org) and the [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) JS charting library).

There are in fact two separate components:

* `summarycharts`: render a standalone collection with `BigDecimal` properties as a chart.  (This component can be thought of as an enhancement of the base `summary` view provided by Isis Wicket viewer).

* `scalarchart`: renders a standalone scalar value (from an action invocation) as a chart



== Screenshots

The following screenshots show the example app's usage of the component with some sample fixture data:

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-wickedcharts/master/images/010-install-fixtures.png)

Note that the example entity (todo item) has two numeric (`BigDecimal`) properties:

=== Summary Charts

Invoking an action that returns a collection of entities:

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-wickedcharts/master/images/030-all-entities.png)

/... shows an additional button to view those entities in a summary chart:

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-wickedcharts/master/images/040-standalone-collection-additional-button-for-summary-chart.png)

Clicking on the button renders a chart where the values of all numeric (`BigDecimal`) properties are plotted:

=== Scalar Charts

Arbitrary charts can be returned from any action.  For example this action:

![](https://raw.github.com/isisaddons/isis-wicket-wickedcharts/master/images/060-arbitrary-charts.png)

... renders a pie chart splitting out the example Todo entities by their category:

== API & Usage

=== Summary Charts

There is no special usage; a standalone collection of any entity with one or more properties of type `BigDecimal` 
will be rendered using the `summarycharts` extension.


=== Scalar Chart

Any action returning the `WickedChart` value type should be rendered as a chart.  The `WickedChart` value type is 
simply a wrapper around the wicked chart's `Options` class:

    import com.googlecode.wickedcharts.highcharts.options.Options;

    public class WickedChart implements Serializable {

        private Options options;
        
        public WickedChart(Options options) { ... }
        ...
    }

Any chart supported by *Wicked Charts* (see their [showcase](http://wicked-charts.appspot.com/) app) should work.  



== How to configure/use

Add the component to your project's `dom` module's `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.isisaddons.wicket.wickedcharts</groupId>
    <artifactId>isis-wicket-wickedcharts-cpt</artifactId>
    <version>1.13.0</version>
</dependency>
----


Check for later releases by searching [Maven Central Repo](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|isis-wicket-wickedcharts-cpt).




== Known issues / Limitations

Although the `WickedChart` class (in the `scalarchart`'s API) has value semantics, it will (currently) not render as a 
chart if used as an entity property.

Such a property should be persistable, however.  

Therefore a workaround is to hide the property and instead provide an action to show the chart.  

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class MyEntity {

    private WickedChart chart;
    @Property(hidden=EVERYWHERE)
    public WickedChart getChart() { ... }
    public void setChart(WickedChart chart) { ... }

    public WickedChart showChart() {
        return getChart();
    }
    ...
}
----
