This module (`incode-module-docfragment`) is a simple wrapper around the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-freemarker[Isis addons' freemarker] module to interpolate fragments of text with respect to a domain object.



The module defines only a single entity - `DocFragment` - which holds the template text.
The result of the interpolation is a simple string; normally the calling object will then persist this somewhere (eg for use when rendering a `Document` as provided by the https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-document[Incode Document] module).



== Screenshots

The home page shows some sample ``DocFragment``s, along with some ``DemoCustomer`` and ``DemoInvoice`` domain objects that use the module:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/010-home-page.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/010-home-page.png"]

There are four ``DocFragment``s for ``DemoCustomer``, with different ``name``s and ``atPath``s, and some ``DocFragment``s for ``DemoInvoice`` with different ``atPath``s.

For a `DemoCustomer` (with a global "/" `atPath`) we can invoke the "render" action:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/020-customer-hello.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/020-customer-hello.png"]

This updates the "rendered" property, interpolating the state from the ``DemoCustomer`` domain object:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/030-customer-hello-rendered.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/030-customer-hello-rendered.png"]

For a different `DemoCustomer` with a different ("/FRA") `atPath`, we can do likewise:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/040-customer-FRA-hello.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/040-customer-FRA-hello.png"]

This looks up a different `DocFragment` (for the "/FRA" `atPath`), resulting in a different rendering:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/050-customer-FRA-hello-rendered.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/050-customer-FRA-hello-rendered.png"]

For the `DemoInvoice`, one of the instances is for an `atPath` ("/ITA") where there is only a global `DocFragment`:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/060-invoice-fallback-to-global.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/060-invoice-fallback-to-global.png"]

When this is rendered:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/070-invoice-due-render.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/070-invoice-due-render.png"]

Then the rendering uses the "global" `DocFragment`:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/080-invoice-due-rendered.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/080-invoice-due-rendered.png"]

Note also that the `DemoInvoice` has a JODA `LocalDate`.
This is interpolated as a date, rather than as a generic Object.



== Domain Model

The following class diagram highlights the main concepts:

image::http://yuml.me/038077f9[link="http://yuml.me/038077f9", width="600px"]

The central concept is `DocFragment`, which holds some Freemarker template text with placeholders to be interpolated by the state of a domain object.
It is identified by an `objectType`, a `name` and an `atPath`:

* the `objectType` represents the type of object that this fragment is intended to interpolate.
This is an alias for the type's concrete class, and is usually defined by `@DomainObject(objectType=...)`.

* the `name` distinguishes between potentially many fragments for a given object type.
There are no restrictions as to its value; it might correspond to the name of a property of the object, or of an action, or anything else.

* the `atPath` (application tenancy path) allows multiple translations of the fragment.
The module will attempt to match the most specific translation, eg "/ITA" (Italy) will take precedence over "/" (Global) if both are present.


The domain object is used in two ways:

* its state is used when interpolating the template text
* (optionally but typically) it is used to infer the `atPath`, in other words which `DocFragment` translation to use.

The API and mandatory SPIs for the module are discussed below.

== API

The programmatic API to the module is `DocFragmentService`:

[source,java]
----
public class DocFragmentService {

    public String render(
            Object domainObject,                                            // <1>
            String name)                                                    // <2>
        throws IOException, TemplateException, RenderException { ... }
        ...
    }

    public String render(                                                   // <3>
                Object domainObject,
                String name,
                String atPath)
        throws IOException, TemplateException, RenderException { ... }
}
----
<1> provides the state for the interpolation into the fragment's template text, and is also used to determine the `atPath` of the `DocFragment` to use to render
<2> corresponds to the `name` of the `DocFragment` to use to render.
<3> overload that allows the `atPath` to be specified explicitly (rather than inferred from the supplied domain object)

The `render(...)` methods will always return the rendered text, else an exception.
A `RenderException` is thrown if a `DocFragment` could not be located.


== SPI

The module defines a single (mandatory) SPI service, `ApplicationTenancyService`:

[source,java]
----
public interface ApplicationTenancyService {
    String atPathFor(Object domainObject);          // <1>
}
----
<1> Used by `DocFragmentService` to determine the `atPath` of the domain object, so as to lookup the appropriate `DocFragment`.



== How to configure/use

You can either use this module "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements. 

=== "Out-of-the-box"

To use "out-of-the-box":

* update your classpath by adding this dependency in your dom project's `pom.xml`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.incode.module.communications</groupId>
    <artifactId>incode-module-communications-dom</artifactId>
    <version>1.14.0</version>
</dependency>
----

* in the `AppManifest`, update its `getModules()` method: +
+
[source,java]
----
@Override
public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
    return Arrays.asList(
            ...
            org.incode.module.docfragment.dom.DocFragmentModuleDomModule.class,
    );
}
----



Notes:

* Check for later releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|incode-module-docfragment-dom[Maven Central Repo].


==== "Out-of-the-box" (-SNAPSHOT)

If you want to use the current `-SNAPSHOT`, then the steps are the same as above, except:

* when updating the classpath, specify the appropriate -SNAPSHOT version:

[source,xml]
----
<version>1.14.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
----

* add the repository definition to pick up the most recent snapshot (we use the Cloudbees continuous integration service).  
We suggest defining the repository in a `<profile>`:

[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>cloudbees-snapshots</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo</id>
            <url>http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false>/enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</profile>
----

* `1.13.0` - released against Isis 1.13.2


== Forking the repo

If instead you want to extend this module's functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo.  The repo is
structured as follows:

* `pom.xml` - parent pom
* `module-dom` - the module implementation itself
* `demo/module-dom` - demo app's supporting domain that uses `module-dom` in some way
* `demo/application` - demo app's app manifest and application-level integration tets
* `demo/webapp` - demo app's webapp, to create war and docker images


Only the `module-dom` project is released to Maven Central Repo.  The versions of the other modules are purposely left at
`0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` because they are not intended to be released.


Note that the module uses link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok].  To compile the code within your IDE you will
therefore require the appropriate Lombok plugin.  See the link:https://projectlombok.org/download.html[Lombok download page] for more information.

=== Dependencies

None.

==  Maven deploy notes

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

=== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd dom
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].



=== Release an Interim Build

If you have commit access to this project (or a fork of your own) then you can create interim releases using the `interim-release.sh` script.

The idea is that this will - in a new branch - update the `dom/pom.xml` with a timestamped version (eg `1.14.0.20170227-0740`).
It then pushes the branch (and a tag) to the specified remote.

A CI server such as Jenkins can monitor the branches matching the wildcard `origin/interim/*` and create a build.
These artifacts can then be published to a snapshot repository.

For example:

[source]
----
sh interim-release.sh 1.14.0 origin
----

where

* `1.14.0` is the base release
* `origin` is the name of the remote to which you have permissions to write to.




=== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.14.0 \
              1.15.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master && git push origin 1.14.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue before trying again.
Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the `autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo).
You may want to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
