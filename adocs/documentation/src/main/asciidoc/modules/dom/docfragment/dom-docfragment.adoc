This module (`incode-module-docfragment`) is a simple wrapper around the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-freemarker[Isis addons' freemarker] module to interpolate fragments of text with respect to a domain object.



The module defines only a single entity - `DocFragment` - which holds the template text.
The result of the interpolation is a simple string; normally the calling object will then persist this somewhere (eg for use when rendering a `Document` as provided by the https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-document[Incode Document] module).



== Screenshots

The home page shows some sample ``DocFragment``s, along with some ``DemoCustomer`` and ``DemoInvoice`` domain objects that use the module:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/010-home-page.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/010-home-page.png"]

There are four ``DocFragment``s for ``DemoCustomer``, with different ``name``s and ``atPath``s, and some ``DocFragment``s for ``DemoInvoice`` with different ``atPath``s.

For a `DemoCustomer` (with a global "/" `atPath`) we can invoke the "render" action:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/020-customer-hello.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/020-customer-hello.png"]

This updates the "rendered" property, interpolating the state from the ``DemoCustomer`` domain object:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/030-customer-hello-rendered.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/030-customer-hello-rendered.png"]

For a different `DemoCustomer` with a different ("/FRA") `atPath`, we can do likewise:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/040-customer-FRA-hello.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/040-customer-FRA-hello.png"]

This looks up a different `DocFragment` (for the "/FRA" `atPath`), resulting in a different rendering:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/050-customer-FRA-hello-rendered.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/050-customer-FRA-hello-rendered.png"]

For the `DemoInvoice`, one of the instances is for an `atPath` ("/ITA") where there is only a global `DocFragment`:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/060-invoice-fallback-to-global.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/060-invoice-fallback-to-global.png"]

When this is rendered:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/070-invoice-due-render.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/070-invoice-due-render.png"]

Then the rendering uses the "global" `DocFragment`:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/080-invoice-due-rendered.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-docfragment/master/images/080-invoice-due-rendered.png"]

Note also that the `DemoInvoice` has a JODA `LocalDate`.
This is interpolated as a date, rather than as a generic Object.



== Domain Model

The following class diagram highlights the main concepts:

image::http://yuml.me/038077f9[link="http://yuml.me/038077f9", width="600px"]

The central concept is `DocFragment`, which holds some Freemarker template text with placeholders to be interpolated by the state of a domain object.
It is identified by an `objectType`, a `name` and an `atPath`:

* the `objectType` represents the type of object that this fragment is intended to interpolate.
This is an alias for the type's concrete class, and is usually defined by `@DomainObject(objectType=...)`.

* the `name` distinguishes between potentially many fragments for a given object type.
There are no restrictions as to its value; it might correspond to the name of a property of the object, or of an action, or anything else.

* the `atPath` (application tenancy path) allows multiple translations of the fragment.
The module will attempt to match the most specific translation, eg "/ITA" (Italy) will take precedence over "/" (Global) if both are present.


The domain object is used in two ways:

* its state is used when interpolating the template text
* (optionally but typically) it is used to infer the `atPath`, in other words which `DocFragment` translation to use.

The API and mandatory SPIs for the module are discussed below.

== API

The programmatic API to the module is `DocFragmentService`:

[source,java]
----
public class DocFragmentService {

    public String render(
            Object domainObject,                                            // <1>
            String name)                                                    // <2>
        throws IOException, TemplateException, RenderException { ... }
        ...
    }

    public String render(                                                   // <3>
                Object domainObject,
                String name,
                String atPath)
        throws IOException, TemplateException, RenderException { ... }
}
----
<1> provides the state for the interpolation into the fragment's template text, and is also used to determine the `atPath` of the `DocFragment` to use to render
<2> corresponds to the `name` of the `DocFragment` to use to render.
<3> overload that allows the `atPath` to be specified explicitly (rather than inferred from the supplied domain object)

The `render(...)` methods will always return the rendered text, else an exception.
A `RenderException` is thrown if a `DocFragment` could not be located.


== SPI

The module defines a single (mandatory) SPI service, `ApplicationTenancyService`:

[source,java]
----
public interface ApplicationTenancyService {
    String atPathFor(Object domainObject);          // <1>
}
----
<1> Used by `DocFragmentService` to determine the `atPath` of the domain object, so as to lookup the appropriate `DocFragment`.



== How to configure/use

=== Classpath

Update your classpath by adding this dependency in your dom project's `pom.xml`:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.incode.module.communications</groupId>

For instructions on how to use the latest `-SNAPSHOT`, see the xref:../../../pages/contributors-guide.adoc#[contributors guide].


=== Bootstrapping

In the `AppManifest`, update its `getModules()` method, eg:

[source,java]
----
@Override
public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
    return Arrays.asList(
            ...
            org.incode.module.docfragment.dom.DocFragmentModuleDomModule.class,
    );
}
