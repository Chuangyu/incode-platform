:_basedir: ../../../

This module (`incode-module-classification`) provides the ability to classify any (arbitrary) domain object as belonging to a pre-defined `Category` within a particular `Taxonomy`.
  A given domain object can only be associated with one `Category` per `Taxonomy`, but each `Category` can optionally have child (sub-) categories.




Not every `Taxonomy` is applicable to every domain object.
Instead, the `Taxonomy` is qualified by both the domain object's type and also its application tenancy (eg country within a multi-tenancy environment).

There are _no_ requirements for those domain objects implement any interfaces.
A subclass of the `Classification`
abstract class is required; this acts as the "glue" between the `Category` and the "classified" domain object.
In total about
50 lines of boilerplate are required, details below.

This module expects that application tenancy path is hierarchical (so for example "/ITA/MIL" resides within both "/ITA" and "/").
This allows ``Taxonomy``s to be declared as applicable at one level (eg "/ITA") and to be considered applicable for domain objects at that level and sub-levels (eg "/ITA/MIL").
The value of the application tenancy path of a domain object is provided through the `ApplicationTenancyService` SPI.

== Domain Model

The following http://yuml.me[] class diagram highlights the main concepts:

image::http://yuml.me/de618edc[link="http://yuml.me/de618edc"]

(The colours used in the diagram are - approximately - from link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Modeling_in_Color[Object Modeling in Color]).


=== `Taxonomy` and `Category`

The `Taxonomy` entity defines a hierarchy of ``Category``s, with the `Taxonomy` itself acting as the root of each such
hierarchy.  In many cases the `Taxonomy` will be only two levels deep, in effect defining a enum, eg:

* "Italian Colours" root classification, with children:
** "Italian Colours/Red"
** "Italian Colours/White"
** "Italian Colours/Green"

However, deeper ``Taxonomy``s are possible, eg:

* "Sizes`
** "Sizes/Small"
*** "Sizes/Small/Smallest"
*** "Sizes/Small/Smaller"
*** "Sizes/Small/Small"
** "Sizes/Medium"
** "Sizes/Large"
*** "Sizes/Large/Large"
*** "Sizes/Large/Larger"
*** "Sizes/Large/Largest"

There can be many such taxonomies; any given domain object can only have one `Classification` per `Taxonomy` hierarchy
(but not more than one classification per hierarchy).  Thus, a domain object might be classified as both
"Italian Colours/Red" and "Sizes/Medium", but it isn't possible to classify as both "Italian Colours/Red" and
"Italian Colours/Green".

=== `Applicability` and `ApplicationTenancyService`

Not every domain object can be classified with respect to every ``Taxonomy``.  Instead, the available set is restricted
by the `Applicability` entity.  This identifies which ``Taxonomy``(s) can be associated with domain object types.
This is further qualified by the application tenancy of the domain object (for multi-tenanted applications).

The `ApplicationTenancyService` SPI service is used to obtain the application tenancy of each domain object.

=== `Classification`

The `Classification` is the tuple that associates a particular domain object with a particular `Category` in some
`Taxonomy`.  This must be with respect to some `Applicability`.  `Classification` itself is an `abstract` class; for
each domain object to be classified, a subclass of `Classification` is required, providing a type-safe (referential
integrity) connection between the two entities.

[NOTE]
====
The module does _not_ prevent an `Applicability` from being removed, even if there are existing ``Classification``s
that rely upon that `Applicability`.
====



== Screenshots

The module's functionality is demonstrated/tested using a demo app.  This has a small hierarchy of app tenancies,
namely "/" (global), "/ITA" (Italy)", "/FRA" (France) and two sub-tenancies of Italy and France, "/ITA/MIL" (Milan) and
"/FRA/PAR" (Paris).

There are two separate domain object types, `DemoObject` and `OtherObject`.  There are five instances of each, in the
various app tenancies.

There are also three example taxonomies: "Sizes", "Italian Colours" and also "French Colours".  These are set up so
that "Sizes" is applicable globally, while the two different "colour" taxonomies apply only to their respective
app tenancies.

To demonstrate that domain type is significant, the "Sizes" and "French Colours" taxonomies apply to `DemoObject` but
do _not_ apply to the `OtherObject`.  The "Italian Colour" taxonomy on the other hand applies to both `DemoObject` and
to `OtherObject`.


=== Taxonomies (reference data)

The screenshots below show the demo app's usage of the module.  We start by installing the demo fixture data:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/010-run-fixture-script.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/010-run-fixture-script.png"]


We can then list the taxonomies:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/030-list-taxonomies.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/030-list-taxonomies.png"]


which returns the three demo taxonomies, "Size", "Italian Colours" and "French Colours":

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/040-view-taxonomy.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/040-view-taxonomy.png"]


The "French Colours" ``Taxonomy`` contains three ``Category``s, namely "Red", "White" and "Blue":

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/050-french-colour-taxonomy.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/050-french-colour-taxonomy.png"]

while the "Italian Colours" ``Taxonomy`` contains three different ``Category``s, "Red", "White" and "Green":

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/060-italian-colour-taxonomy.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/060-italian-colour-taxonomy.png"]

Note that the "French Colours"' "Red" is different from the "Italian Colours"' "Red", also for "White".  These are two
different ``Category``s in two different ``Taxonomy``s that just happen to have the same (local) name.

Also note (as can be guessed from their names) that the "French Colours" `Taxonomy` only applies to the "/FRA" app
tenancy, while the "Italian Colours" `Taxonomy` applies only to the "/ITA" app tenancy.  The former also only to the
`DemoObject` domain type, while the latter apples to both `DemoObject` and also `OtherObject` domain types.


The final `Taxonomy` is "Size":

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/070-size-taxonomy.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/070-size-taxonomy.png"]

In contrast to the two "colour" taxonomies, the "Size" taxonomy is defined globally (for the "/" app tenancy).  However,
it only applies to the ``DemoObject`` domain type, not to the ``OtherObject`` domain type.

The "Size" taxonomy is also more complex than the other two taxonomies, in that contains categories and sub-categories:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/080-size-taxonomy-hierarchy.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/080-size-taxonomy-hierarchy.png"]

The table below summarizes the various taxonomies and their applicability:

=== Domain Object Data

The example app creates 5 instances of `DemoObject`, each in a different app tenancy:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/090-view-demo-foo.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/090-view-demo-foo.png"]

The "foo" `DemoObject` is in the "/ITA" app tenancy, which means that the "Italian Colours" and "Sizes" taxonomies both
apply.  The example seed data adds ``Classification``s for this object in each of these taxonomies.  As the screenshot
shows, no further ``Classification``s can be added:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/100-demo-foo-cannot-classify.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/100-demo-foo-cannot-classify.png"]

The "bar" `DemoObject` is in the "/FRA" app tenancy, which means that the "French Colours" and "Sizes" taxonomies both
apply.  The example seed data adds a `Classification` for the "Sizes" taxonomy, which means that the object can still
be classified (in the "French Colours" taxonomy):

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/110-demo-bar-can-classify.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/110-demo-bar-can-classify.png"]


Since there is only one applicable taxonomy ("French Colours"), this is automatically defaulted.  The end-user can
then select the particular `Category` within that `Taxonomy`:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/120-demo-bar-classify-french-colours.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/120-demo-bar-classify-french-colours.png"]


The "baz" `DemoObject` on the other hand starts off with no ``Classification``s. Because this has global app tenancy,
only the "Sizes" `Taxonomy` applies:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/130-demo-baz-global-classify-only-size-available.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/130-demo-baz-global-classify-only-size-available.png"]


We can also view the `OtherObject` instances:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/140-view-others.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/140-view-others.png"]


Like `DemoObject`, there are five instances of `OtherObject`, again each with a different app tenancy:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/150-view-other-foo.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/150-view-other-foo.png"]

The difference between `OtherObject` and `DemoObject` is that neither the "Sizes" nor "French Colours" taxonomies are
applicable to ``OtherObject``.  Thus, with the "foo" ``OtherObject`` the only available taxonomy to classify is "Italian Colours":

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/160-other-cannot-classify-size.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/160-other-cannot-classify-size.png"]

Once a `Classification` has been made, it can be altered to any other `Category` within the same `Taxonomy`:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/170-view-other-foo-change-classification-category.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/170-view-other-foo-change-classification-category.png"]

Here the `Classification` is being changed:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/180-change-classification-category-prompt.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/180-change-classification-category-prompt.png"]


Which we can see _has_ then been changed:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/190-change-classification-category.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/190-change-classification-category.png"]


It is also possible to change each ``Category``'s name, reference and (sorting) ordinal.  If the name or ordinal are
changed then the fully qualified name/ordinal are automatically updated for both the `Category` and any of its children.

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/200-change-name-ref-sorting-ordinal.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/200-change-name-ref-sorting-ordinal.png"]




== How to configure/use

You can either use this module "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements. 

=== "Out-of-the-box"

To use "out-of-the-box":

* update your classpath by adding this dependency in your dom project's `pom.xml`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.incode.module.classification</groupId>
    <artifactId>incode-module-classification-dom</artifactId>
    <version>1.13.1</version>
</dependency>
----

* in the `AppManifest`, update its `getModules()` method: +
+
[source,java]
----
@Override
public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
    return Arrays.asList(
            ...
            org.incode.module.classification.dom.ClassificationModule.class,
    );
}
----




Notes:

* Check for later releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|incode-module-classification-dom[Maven Central Repo].


==== "Out-of-the-box" (-SNAPSHOT)

If you want to use the current `-SNAPSHOT`, then the steps are the same as above, except:

* when updating the classpath, specify the appropriate -SNAPSHOT version:

[source,xml]
----
<version>1.14.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
----

* add the repository definition to pick up the most recent snapshot (we use the Cloudbees continuous integration service).  We suggest defining the repository in a `<profile>`:

[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>cloudbees-snapshots</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo<;/id>
            <url>http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false>/enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</profile>
----


=== For each domain object...

For each domain object that you want to classify (that is, add ``Classification``s to), you need to:

* implement a subclass of `Classification` for the domain object's type. +
+
This link acts as a type-safe tuple linking the domain object to the `Category`.

* implement the `ApplicationTenancyService` SPI interface: +
+
[source,java]
----
public interface ApplicationTenancyService {
    String atPathFor(final Object domainObjectToClassify);
}
----
+
This allows the module to find which taxonomies are applicable to the domain object.

* implement the `ClassificationRepository.SubtypeProvider` SPI interface: +
+
[source,java]
----
public interface SubtypeProvider {
    Class<? extends Classification> subtypeFor(Class<?> domainObject);
}
----
+
This tells the module which subclass of `Classification` to use to attach to the "classified" domain object.  The
`SubtypeProviderAbstract` adapter can be used to remove some boilerplate.

* subclass `T_classify`, `T_unclassify` and `T_classifications` (abstract) mixin classes for the domain object. +
+
These contribute the "classifications" collection and actions to add and remove ``Classification``s.

Typically the SPI implementations and the mixin classes are nested static classes of the `Classification` subtype.



For example, in the demo app the `DemoObject` can be classified by virtue of the
link:https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/blob/master/fixture/src/main/java/org/incode/module/classification/fixture/app/classification/demo/ClassificationForDemoObject.java[`ClassificationForDemoObject`] subclass:

[source,java]

    }
    public void setDemoObject(final DemoObject demoObject) {
        this.demoObject = demoObject;
    }

    public Object getClassified() {                                                 // <3>
        return getDemoObject();

        setDemoObject((DemoObject) classified);
    }

        @Override
        public String atPathFor(final Object domainObjectToClassify) {
            if(domainObjectToClassify instanceof DemoObject) {
                return ((DemoObject) domainObjectToClassify).getAtPath();
            }
            return null;
        }
    }

    @DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)

----
<1> extend from `Classification`

this will correspond to a regular foreign key with referential integrity constraints correctly applied.

this case `DemoObject`) to be set.  Also implemented `getClassified()` similarly
<4> implementation of the `ApplicationTenancyService` for the domain object, telling the module the app tenancy of
the domain object to be classified.  If there is no implementation of this service (but the mixins have been defined)

actions disabled.
<5> implementation of the `SubtypeProvider` SPI domain service, telling the module which subclass of `Classification`

<6> mixins for the collections and actions contributed to the "classified" domain object



== UI Concerns

The attached `Classification` objects are shown in two contexts: as a table of `Classification` objects for the
"classified" domain object, and then as the actual subtype when the classification object itself is shown (eg
`ClassificationForDemoObject` in the demo app).

In the former case (as a table) the `Classification` will be rendered according to the `Classification.layout.xml`
provided by the module.  In the latter (as an object) the classification will be rendered according to the layout
provided by the consuming app, offering full control of the layout.  The layout provided in the demo app
(ie link:https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/blob/master/fixture/src/main/java/org/incode/module/classification/fixture/app/classification/demo/ClassificationForDemoObject.layout.xml[`ClassificationForDemoObject.layout.xml`])
is a good starting point.

The module also allows the title, icon and CSS for `Classification`, `Category` and `Applicability` objects to be
customised.  In all three cases this done using subscribers.  By default the values of the title/icon/CSS class is
obtained using default subscribers, eg `Classification.TitleSubscriber`, `Classification.IconSubscriber` and
`Classification.CssClassSubscriber`.  The consuming module can override these values simply by providing alternative
implementations.



== Other Services

The module provides the following domain services for querying aliases:

* `CategoryRepository` +
+
To search for existing ``Category``s, and to create top-level ``Taxonomy``s.  Children are created from
`Category` itself.

* `ClassificationRepository` +
+
To search for ``Classification``s, ie the tuple that links an `Category` with an arbitrary "classified" domain object.
