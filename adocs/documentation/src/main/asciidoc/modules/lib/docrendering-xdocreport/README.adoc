This module, intended for use with link:http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis], provides an implementation of the Incode http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-document[Document] module's `Renderer` interface using the (non-ASF) http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-xdocreport[Isis addons' xdocreport] module.


== API

The module provides two different implementations of `Renderer`:

* `RendererForXDocReportToDocx` which implements `RendererFromBytesToBytes`
** uses Freemarker to mail-merge a Word template document, returning the `byte[]` of the resultant Word document
* `RendererForXDocReportToPdf` which implements `RendererFromBytesToBytes`
** almost the same as the previous renderer, but returns a `byte[]` array of a PDF rather than a Word document.


These classes can be used as the `Renderer` implementation for a Document `RenderingStrategy`.
Subclasses of the `RenderingStrategyFSAbstract` fixture script can be used to create such an entity, eg:

* `RenderingStrategyFSForXDocReportToDocx` +
+
[source,java]
----
public class RenderingStrategyFSForXDocReportToDocx extends RenderingStrategyFSAbstract {
    public static final String REF = "XDD";
    @Override
    protected void execute(ExecutionContext executionContext) {
        upsertRenderingStrategy(
                REF,
                "XDocReport to .docx",
                DocumentNature.BYTES,
                DocumentNature.BYTES,
                RendererForXDocReportToDocx.class, executionContext);
    }
}
----

* `RenderingStrategyFSForXDocReportToPdf` +
+
[source,java]
----
public class RenderingStrategyFSForXDocReportToPdf extends RenderingStrategyFSAbstract {
    public static final String REF = "XDP";
    @Override
    protected void execute(ExecutionContext executionContext) {
        upsertRenderingStrategy(
                REF,
                "XDocReport to .pdf",
                DocumentNature.BYTES,
                DocumentNature.BYTES,
                RendererForXDocReportToPdf.class, executionContext);
    }
}
----


The Incode http://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-document[document] module also allows ``RenderingStrategy``s to be created from the UI; it will "discover" all `Renderer` implementations from the classpath.




== How to configure/use

You can either use this module "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements.

=== "Out-of-the-box"

To use "out-of-the-box":

* update your classpath by adding this dependency in your dom project's `pom.xml`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.incode.module.docrendering</groupId>
    <artifactId>incode-module-docrendering-xdocreport-dom</artifactId>
    <version>1.14.0</version>
</dependency>
----

* in the `AppManifest`, update its `getModules()` method: +
+
[source,java]
----
@Override
public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
    return Arrays.asList(
            ...
            org.incode.module.docrendering.xdocreport.dom.XdocReportDocRenderingModule.class,
    );
}
----

Notes:

* Check for later releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|incode-module-docrendering-xdocreport-dom[Maven Central Repo].



==== "Out-of-the-box" (-SNAPSHOT)

If you want to use the current `-SNAPSHOT`, then the steps are the same as above, except:

* when updating the classpath, specify the appropriate -SNAPSHOT version:

[source,xml]
----
<version>1.14.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
----

* add the repository definition to pick up the most recent snapshot (we use the Cloudbees continuous integration service).  We suggest defining the repository in a `<profile>`:

[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>cloudbees-snapshots</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo</id>
            <url>http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false>/enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</profile>

== Known issues

(none currently)


== Change Log

* `1.14.0` - released against Isis 1.14.0
* `1.13.1` - released against Isis 1.13.0, and fixes https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-docrendering-xdocreport/issues/1[#1] (use v1.13.1 of https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-xdocreport[isis-module-xdocreport])
* `1.13.0` - released against Isis 1.13.0



== Forking the repo

If instead you want to extend this module's functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo.  The repo is
structured as follows:

* `pom.xml` - parent pom
* `dom` - the module implementation, depends on Isis applib

Only the `dom` project is released to Maven Central Repo.  The versions of the other modules are purposely left at
`0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` because they are not intended to be released.

=== Dependencies

None.



==  Maven deploy notes

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

=== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd dom
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].


=== Release an Interim Build

If you have commit access to this project (or a fork of your own) then you can create interim releases using the `interim-release.sh` script.

The idea is that this will - in a new branch - update the `dom/pom.xml` with a timestamped version (eg `1.14.0.20170227-0738`).
It then pushes the branch (and a tag) to the specified remote.

A CI server such as Jenkins can monitor the branches matching the wildcard `origin/interim/*` and create a build.
These artifacts can then be published to a snapshot repository.

For example:

[source]
----
sh interim-release.sh 1.14.0 origin
----

where

* `1.14.0` is the base release
* `origin` is the name of the remote to which you have permissions to write to.



=== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.14.0 \
              1.15.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master && git push origin 1.14.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again.  Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the 
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo).  You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
