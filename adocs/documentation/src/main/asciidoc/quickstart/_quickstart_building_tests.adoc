The generated application includes unit tests, integration tests and BDD cucumber specifications.
All of these are executed using the surefire plugin, which is configured to follow a naming convention:

.Test configurations
[cols="^.^2,^.^2a,<.^3a,<.^2a,<.^2a", options="header"]
|===

^.>| Test type
^.>| Naming convention
^.>| Used in Module(s)
^.>| Disabled using
^.>| Generated Reports

| Unit tests
| `*_Test`
|`module-simple`
| `-DskipUT`
| `target/surefire-unittest-reports`

| Integration tests
| `*_IntegTest`
| `module-simple`; `appdefn`
| `-DskipIT`
| `target/surefire-integtest-reports`

| BDD specs
| `*_IntegBddSpec`
| `appdefn`
| `-DskipBS`
| `target/surefire-integbddspecs-reports`

|===

It's also possible to disable all tests using the usual `-DskipTests` flag.

The reports are generated relative to the module that contains the tests.
Such reports can be picked up by your continuous integration server.

In addition, the BDD specs also generate a (very simple) website at `target/cucumber-html-report/index.html`, and a (much richer) website at `target/cucumber-reports/cucumber-html-reports/overview-features.html`.

One thing to be aware of: if a unit test or integration test fails, then the build will break.
However, note that if a BDD spec "fails" (eg due to a missing binding), then the build continues; the failure is shown in the generated cucumber report instead.

The configuration of tests in the Maven `pom.xml` project files is done using the _surefire_ and _cucumberreporting_ maven mixins, discussed xref:quickstart.adoc#_quickstart_maven-mixins[below].
