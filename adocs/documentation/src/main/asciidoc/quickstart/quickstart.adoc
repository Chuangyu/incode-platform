The quickstart is a Maven archetype intended to be used as a template for new applications.

Like the Apache Isis framework's own link:http://isis.apache.org#guides/ugfun/ugfun.html#_ugfun_getting-started_simpleapp-archetype[simpleapp archetype], the application provides a `SimpleObject` to adapt and copy, along with supporting unit tests, integration tests and BDD (cucumber) specs.

The application generated from the archetype is also preconfigured with the dependencies for all of the modules available in the Incode Platform, with xref:../modules/spi/audit/spi-audit.adoc#[auditing], xref:../modules/spi/command/spi-command.adoc#[command] profiling, xref:../modules/spi/security/spi-security.adoc#[security], xref:../modules/ext/flywaydb/ext-flywaydb.adoc#[flywaydb] and (feature) xref:../modules/ext/togglz/ext-togglz.adoc#[togglz] enabled by default.
The application also configures the _Quartz scheduler_ for background scheduling, and the _Jolokia_ servlet, allowing consoles such as _hawt.io_ to monitor the internal state of the webapp.

The generated application also includes example code to:

* xref:quickstart-with-embedded-camel.adoc#[bootstrap] a _Spring Framework_ context alongside the Apache Isis framework, hosting embedded _Apache Camel_ and _Apache ActiveMQ_ instances

* xref:quickstart-with-example-usage.adoc#[demonstrate usage] of the various modules within the Incode Platform.

These can be easily included or excluded just by commenting in/out small sections of code.


[[__quickstart_prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

The prerequisite software is:

* Java JDK 8
* http://maven.apache.org[maven 3] (3.5.0 or later is recommended).


We also strongly recommend an IDE;
the Incode Platform developers use JetBrains IntelliJ Community Edition.


[[__quickstart_running-the-archetype]]
== Running the archetype

Use Maven to generate your application from the `quickstart-archetype`:

[source,bash]
----
mvn archetype:generate  \
    -D archetypeGroupId=org.incode.platform.archetype \
    -D archetypeArtifactId=quickstart-archetype \
    -D archetypeVersion=1.15.0 \
    -D archetypeCatalog=local \
    -D groupId=com.mycompany \
    -D artifactId=myapp \
    -D version=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
    -B
----

Change the `groupId` and `artifactId` as required.

The application will be generated in a directory named after the artifact (`myapp` in the example above):

[source]
----
cd myapp
----



[[__quickstart_project-structure]]
== Project Structure

The diagram below shows the basic structure of the quickstart app:

image::{_imagesdir}project-structure/module-dependencies.png[width="400px",link="{_imagesdir}project-structure/module-dependencies.png"]


TODO: some words about what these all have


And here's the generated app once loaded into IntelliJ;
by default the `example` modules are excluded from the project:

image::{_imagesdir}project-structure/quickstart-app-loaded-into-intellij.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}project-structure/quickstart-app-loaded-into-intellij.png"]


See the Apache Isis documentation for link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/dg/dg.html#__dg_ide_intellij_importing-maven-modules[further guidance].



[[__quickstart_building]]
== Building (and tests)


To build the generated app:

[source]
----
mvn clean install
----

This will compile the code and automatically run all tests (discussed in more detail xref:quickstart.adoc#__quickstart_building_tests[below]), and it also package up the application as a WAR file (namely, `webapp/target/myapp.war`).



[[__quickstart_building_tests]]
=== Tests

The generated application includes unit tests, integration tests and BDD cucumber specifications.
All of these are executed using the surefire plugin, which is configured to follow a naming convention:

.Test configurations
[cols="^.^2,^.^2a,<.^3a,<.^2a,<.^2a", options="header"]
|===

^.>| Test type
^.>| Naming convention
^.>| Used in Module(s)
^.>| Disabled using
^.>| Generated Reports

| Unit tests
| `*_Test`
|`module-simple`
| `-DskipUT`
| `target/surefire-unittest-reports`

| Integration tests
| `*_IntegTest`
| `module-simple`; `appdefn`
| `-DskipIT`
| `target/surefire-integtest-reports`

| BDD specs
| `*_IntegBddSpec`
| `appdefn`
| `-DskipBS`
| `target/surefire-integbddspecs-reports`

|===

It's also possible to disable all tests using the usual `-DskipTests` flag.

The reports are generated relative to the module that contains the tests.
Such reports can be picked up by your continuous integration server.

In addition, the BDD specs also generate a (very simple) website at `target/cucumber-html-report/index.html`, and a (much richer) website at `target/cucumber-reports/cucumber-html-reports/overview-features.html`.

image::{_imagesdir}building/tests/cucumber-report.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}building/tests/cucumber-report.png"]


One thing to be aware of: if a unit test or integration test fails, then the build will break.
However, note that if a BDD spec "fails" (eg due to a missing binding), then the build continues; the failure is shown in the generated cucumber report instead.

The configuration of tests in the Maven `pom.xml` project files is done using the _surefire_ and _cucumberreporting_ maven mixins, discussed xref:quickstart.adoc#__quickstart_maven-mixins[below].



[[__quickstart_building-and-running_metamodel-validation]]
=== Metamodel validation

The generated application also configures the link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/rgmvn/rgmvn.html[Apache Isis maven plugin] to link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/rgmvn/rgmvn.html#_rgmvn_validate[validate] the domain application.

For example, if a supporting method for an action `findByName` is misspelt, then this will be reported and the build will fail.

Running metamodel validation does require bootstrapping the application, so will lengthen the overall build time.
If required, the metamodel validation can be skipped using `-Dskip.isis-validate`.

In the quickstart app the metamodel validation plugin is configured in the `module-simple` module.

The configuration in the Maven `pom.xml` project files is done using the _isis-validate mavenmixin_, discussed xref:quickstart.adoc#__quickstart_maven-mixins[below].



[[__quickstart_building-and-running_swagger-spec]]
=== Swagger spec

The generated application also configures the link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/rgmvn/rgmvn.html[Apache Isis maven plugin] to link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/rgmvn/rgmvn.html#_rgmvn_swagger[generate a Swagger spec] file.
This can, for example, be used to generate stubs in various programming languages.

Generating the swagger spec does require bootstrapping the application, so will lengthen the overall build time.
If reuired, the swagger generation can be skipped using `-Dskip.isis-swagger`.

When run, it generates swagger files in `target/generated-resources/isis-swagger`, relative to module that configures the plugin.

In the quickstart app, the plugin is configured to run in the `appdefn` module (so providing a single spec for the entire app).

The configuration in the Maven `pom.xml` project files is done using the _isis-swagger_ mavenmixin, discussed xref:quickstart.adoc#__quickstart_maven-mixins[below].



[[__quickstart_running]]
== Running

There are a number of ways that you can run your application.


[[__quickstart_running_ide]]
=== IDE

When developing an Apache Isis application, you'll typically want to run the app from within the IDE.
Not only does this reduce the feedback loop (no need to package and deploy, for example), you can also very easily set up debugging breakpoints and the like.

To run the app from the IDE, we use Apache Isis' `org.apache.isis.WebServer`, which runs the app as a command line application.
This starts up an embedded Jetty instance configured to run the webapp.

For example, here's the launch configuration to run the generated application from IntelliJ:

image::{_imagesdir}running/ide/intellij-run-configuration.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}running/ide/intellij-run-configuration.png"]

That is to say:

* main-class: `org.apache.isis.WebServer`
* program args: `-m domainapp.appdefn.DomainAppAppManifest`

using:

[source,java]
----
mvn -Denhance -Dskip.default datanucleus:enhance -T1C -o
----

run against the parent pom to enhance the JDO domain entities.
See the Apache Isis documentation for link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/dg/dg.html#http://isis.apache.org/guides/dg/dg.html#__dg_ide_intellij_running[further guidance].

When the application is started this way, it runs without any fixtures, that is, using `domainapp.appdefn.DomainAppAppManifest` configured in `webapp/WEB-INF/isis.properties`.
Whis means that the only user account available is the default superuser provided by the xref:../modules/spi/security/spi-security.adoc#[security module], namely `isis-module-security-admin`/`pass`.


image::{_imagesdir}running/ide/run-app-login-isis-module-security-admin.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}running/ide/run-app-login-isis-module-security-admin.png"]

The home page shows only the security module's menu, not the domain app's entities (`SimpleObject`'s menu etc):

image::{_imagesdir}running/ide/run-app-home-page-isis-module-security-admin.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}running/ide/run-app-home-page-isis-module-security-admin.png"]


Manually setting up a user and permissions to be able to access the business domain would be tedious to say the least.
So instead we can use an extended version of the app manifest which will also run some fixtures.
These set up a user account and also some dummy data.


For example, here's the updated launch configuration using the app manifest:

image::{_imagesdir}running/ide/intellij-run-configuration-with-fixtures.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}running/ide/intellij-run-configuration-with-fixtures.png"]

That is to say:

* program args: `-m domainapp.appdefn.DomainAppAppManifestWithFixtures`

When we run the app again, we can now log in using a new `sven/pass` user account:

image::{_imagesdir}running/ide/run-app-login.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}running/ide/run-app-login.png"]

The home page now shows a `Simple Objects` menu:

image::{_imagesdir}running/ide/run-app-home-page.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}running/ide/run-app-home-page.png"]

from whence we can access the ``SimpleObject``s also created by the fixture:

image::{_imagesdir}running/ide/run-app-SimpleObject.png[width="800px",link="{_imagesdir}running/ide/run-app-SimpleObject.png"]

Note also the additional menus on the right-hand side to access other modules set up and accessible to the `sven` superuser.
These are discussed in more detail xref:quickstart.adoc#__quickstart_features[below].




[[__quickstart_running_mvn]]
=== mvn (jetty:run)

If you want to run the application without even loading it into the IDE, then you can do this using the maven Jetty plugin:

[source]
----
mvn -pl webapp jetty:run
----

However, note that this will run with the standard `DomainAppAppManifest`, as configured in `WEB-INF/isis.properties`; the only user account is `isis-module-security-admin`.

More than likely you'll want to override the manifest; you can do this using a system property.
For example:

[source]
----
 mvn -pl webapp jetty:run \
         -Disis.appManifest=domainapp.appdefn.DomainAppAppManifestWithFixtures
----


The configuration in the Maven `pom.xml` project files for the jetty plugin that provides this feature is done using the _jettywar_ mavenmixin, discussed xref:quickstart.adoc#__quickstart_maven-mixins[below].


[[__quickstart_running_webapp]]
=== Webapp

The application can also be run in a servlet container, using the `.war` file generated from the usual build.
For example:

[source,bash]
----
mvn install
----

will result in a `xxx-webapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.war` (where xxx is the project's `artifactId`) generated in `webapp/target`.
This can then be deployed to the servlet container in the normal way.
For example, if deploying to http://tomcat.apache.org[Apache Tomcat], copy to the `webapps/` directory.

If you want to change the manifest (or any other property), it is possible to override the configuration externally.
See the Apache Isis docs for link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugbtb/ugbtb.html#_ugbtb_deployment_tomcat[further guidance].

The configuration in the Maven `pom.xml` project files for maven's war plugin is done using the _jettywar_ mavenmixin, discussed xref:quickstart.adoc#__quickstart_maven-mixins[below].


[[__quickstart_running_standalone]]
=== Standalone

Yet another alternative is to build the webapp to run standalone as a single "uber-jar", once again using Jetty as an embedded instance; useful perhaps for distributing prototypes of your application for review.

Building the standalone jar is done by setting the `-Dmavenmixin-jettyconsole` property.
For example:

[source,bash]
----
mvn install \
    -Dmavenmixin-jettyconsole \
    -DskipTests -Dskip.isis-validate -Dskip.isis-swagger
----


will result in a `xxx-webapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jetty-console.war` (where xxx is the project's `artifactId`) generated in `webapp/target`.
This can then be running using java, eg:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar webapp/target/myapp-webapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jetty-console.war
----

This displays a Swing UI from which the webapp can be started.

image::{_imagesdir}running/jetty-console/jetty-console-ui.png[width="400px",link="{_imagesdir}running/jetty-console/jetty-console-ui.png"]


It's also possible to run headless, or to change the port.
And again, the manifest can be changed using a system property.
For example:

[source,bash]
----
java -Disis.appManifest=domainapp.appdefn.DomainAppAppManifestWithFixtures \
     -jar webapp/target/myapp-webapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jetty-console.war \
          --headless \
          --port 9090
----


The configuration in the Maven `pom.xml` project files for the jettyconsole plugin that provides this feature is done using the _jettyconsole_ mavenmixin, discussed xref:quickstart.adoc#__quickstart_maven-mixins[below].



[[__quickstart_running_docker]]
=== Docker

Finally, it's also possible to package up and run the webapp as a Docker container.

* to package the webapp as a Docker image:
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn install \
    -Dmavenmixin-docker -Ddocker-plugin.imageName=test/myapp \
    -DskipTests -Dskip.isis-vaidate
----

* and to run it:

+
[source,bash]
----
docker container run -p 8080:8080 -d test/myapp
----


[NOTE]
====
On Windows, you may need to enable the Docker daemon first, otherwise the "mvn install" command above will fail:

image::{_imagesdir}running/docker/on-windows/010-docker-localhost-2375.png[width="400px",link="{_imagesdir}running/docker/on-windows/010-docker-localhost-2375.png"]
====


This will bootstrap the application; `docker container ps` will show all running containers.
Alternatively, Kitematic provides a simple UI to view and interact with running containers:

image::{_imagesdir}running/docker/kitematic.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}running/docker/kitematic.png"]

When the application is started this way, it runs without any fixtures, that is, using `domainapp.appdefn.DomainAppAppManifest` configured in `webapp/WEB-INF/isis.properties`.
There are a variety of ways to override this, to start the app with a different app manifest, but these easiest is to use the `$ISIS_OPT` environment variable.
This contains a set of key:value pairs concatenated together.
The `scripts/rundocker.sh` script is a simple wrapper that reads all properties from an externally specified configuration file and starts the docker container correctly.
For example:

[source,bash]
----
pushd scripts
rundocker.sh test/myapp isis-overrides.properties -p 8080:8080
popd
----

where

* `test/myapp` is the name of the image to be run

* `-p 8080:8080` is passed through to the `docker run` command


See the Apache Isis docs for link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/ugbtb/ugbtb.html#_ugbtb_deployment_docker[further guidance] on deploying with Docker.

The configuration in the Maven `pom.xml` project files for the docker plugin that provides this feature is done using the _docker_ mavenmixin, discussed xref:quickstart.adoc#__quickstart_maven-mixins[below].



=== Running against an external database

All of the examples listed above run the application against an in-memory HSQLDB database.
Obviously though at some point you'll want to persist your data against an external database.

To do so just requires that overriding four configuration properties that specify the JDBC driver, JDBC URL, user and password.
It also (of course) requires that the JDBC driver is configured as a `<dependency>` in the webapp's `pom.xml`.


For example, to run the quickstart application against SQL Server:

* create a new and empty database, eg `myappdb`, with corresponding user and password, `myappdbo/s3cr3t!`, say.

* link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/using-the-jdbc-driver[download] the `mssql-jdbc-6.2.1.jre8.jar` driver, and install locally using: +
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=mssql-jdbc-6.2.1.jre8.jar \
                     -DgroupId=com.microsoft.sqlserver \
                     -DartifactId=jdbc \
                     -Dversion=6.2.1 \
                     -Dpackaging=jar
----

* edit the `webapp/pom.xml` to include the sqljdbc4 driver: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>jdbc-mssql</id>
    <activation>
        <property>
            <name>!skip.jdbc-mssql</name>
        </property>
    </activation>
    <dependencies>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>com.microsoft.sqlserver</groupId>
           <artifactId>jdbc</artifactId>
           <version>6.2.1</version>
       </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</profile>
----

* change (by simply editing in `isis.properties`) or override (eg by passing in as `-D` system properties) the following configuration properties:
+
[source,properties]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionDriverName=com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL=jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433;instance=.;databaseName=myappdb
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionUserName=myappdbo
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.javax.jdo.option.ConnectionPassword=s3cr3t!
----


For example, an IntelliJ launch configuration can specify system properties:

image::{_imagesdir}running/external-db/intellij-run-configuration-with-jdbc-overrides.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}running/external-db/intellij-run-configuration-with-jdbc-overrides.png"]

where the system properties dialog is:

image::{_imagesdir}running/external-db/intellij-run-configuration-with-jdbc-overrides-system-properties.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}running/external-db/intellij-run-configuration-with-jdbc-overrides-system-properties.png"]


When the application has started the tables should have been automatically created (by virtue of the `isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll=true` configuration property in `isis.properties`):

image::{_imagesdir}running/external-db/sqlserver-tables-automatically-created.png[width="400px",link="{_imagesdir}running/external-db/sqlserver-tables-automatically-created.png"]

with 10 `SimpleObject` instances created through the fixture:

image::{_imagesdir}running/external-db/sqlserver-table-SimpleObject.png[width="500px",link="{_imagesdir}running/external-db/sqlserver-table-SimpleObject.png"]


[TIP]
====
If running against a persistent datastore, then remember that the fixture script should only be run the very first time you run up the application.
Thereafter, switch to the regular app manifest (`domainapp.appdefn.DomainAppAppManifest`); otherwise you'll likely get INSERT errors on start up (trying to re-insert the same dummy data).
====

[[__quickstart_features]]
== Features

Now we've explored how to run the application, let's explore some of the features already configured in the quickstart.


[[__quickstart_features_security]]
=== Security

The xref:../modules/spi/security/spi-security.adoc#[security module] provides authentication and authorisation, implemented by an link:http://shiro.apache.org[Apache Shiro] Realm.
Optionally authentication can be delegated to a secondary Realm, for example to use an LDAP registry.

Each logged-in user has a corresponding `ApplicationUser` account, accessible from the "me" menu item:





security seed data, xref togglz


[[__quickstart_features_session-logger]]
=== Session Logger


[[__quickstart_features_commands]]
=== Commands


[[__quickstart_features_auditing]]
=== Auditing



[[__quickstart_features_publishing]]
=== Publishing

The xref:xref:quickstart.adoc#__quickstart_features_publishing[basic quickstart supports publishing] only in so far as it uses the default implementation of link:http://isis.apache.org/guides/rgsvc/rgsvc.html#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-spi_PublisherService[PublisherService] provided by Apache Isis itself.

For example, the `SimpleObject#notes` property has publishing enabled:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.Column(allowsNull = "true", length = 4000)
@Property(
        editing = Editing.ENABLED,
        command = CommandReification.ENABLED,
        publishing = Publishing.ENABLED         // <1>
)
@Getter @Setter
private String notes;
----
<1> publishing enabled

and similarly, so does the `SimpleObject#updateName` action:

[source,java]
----
@Action(
        semantics = SemanticsOf.IDEMPOTENT,
        command = CommandReification.ENABLED,
        publishing = Publishing.ENABLED         // <1>
)
public SimpleObject updateName(
        @Parameter(maxLength = 40)
        final String name) {
    setName(name);
    return this;
}
----
<1> publishing enabled

Invoking either of these will log to the console, eg:

TODO: screenshot of logging here.


Configuring the quickstart app to run with xref:quickstart-with-embedded-camel.adoc#__quickstart-with-embedded-camel_including-the-example-modules[embedded camel] includes the `publishmq` module which publishes to an ActiveMQ queue.


xref:quickstart-with-embedded-camel.adoc#__quickstart-with-embedded-camel_features_publishing[embedded camel]


TODO: xref enhanced publishing in "embedded camel"


[[__quickstart_features_togglz]]
=== Togglz


[[__quickstart_features_quartz]]
=== Quartz




=== Dynamic Reloading

  - reload gradle







[[__quickstart_features_flywaydb]]
=== FlywayDB

TODO: as per the flywaydb, generate the schema

TODO: provide a simple flyway scripts, one to create the database with name set to varchar(30), then another alter table that changes to varchar(50).


The app will bootstrap against an in-memory database, however it will be Flyway that sets up the database schema (rather than DataNucleus automatically creating the database as might normally be the case).
This is discussed in a little more detail xref:what-happens-during-bootstrapping[below].

Then log on using user: `sven`, password: `pass`



* configure to auto-create schema/tables in empty database, by adding to `persistor_datanucleus.properties`: +
+
[source,properties]
----
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll=true
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.schema.validateTables=true
isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.schema.validateConstraints=true
----





[[__quickstart_maven-mixins]]
== Maven Mixins

To minimize boilerplate, the Maven `pom.xml` files use the `com.github.odavid.maven.plugins:mixin-maven-plugin`.
This allows the `<build>` definitions of other `pom.xml` files to be "mixed in to" (that is, included in) the consuming `pom.xml`.

The maven mixins themselves used by the generated application are listed in the table below:
