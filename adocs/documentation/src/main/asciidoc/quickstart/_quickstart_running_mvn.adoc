If you want to run the application without even loading it into the IDE, then you can do this using the maven Jetty plugin:

[source]
----
mvn -pl webapp jetty:run
----

The "-pl webapp" argument indicates that the command is run in the "webapp" subdirectory/submodule.

However, note that this will run with the standard `DomainAppAppManifest`, as configured in `WEB-INF/isis.properties`; the only user account is `isis-module-security-admin`.

More than likely you'll want to override the manifest; you can do this using a system property.
For example:

[source]
----
 mvn -pl webapp jetty:run \
         -Disis.appManifest=domainapp.appdefn.DomainAppAppManifestWithFixtures
----


The configuration in the Maven `pom.xml` project files for the jetty plugin that provides this feature is done using the _jettywar_ mavenmixin, discussed xref:quickstart.adoc#_quickstart_maven-mixins[below].
