The xref:../modules/ext/flywaydb/ext-flywaydb.adoc#[flywaydb extension] integrates FlywayDB to automatically handle database migrations.
These ensure that the schema of the (production) database is in sync with that required by the domain entities.

To demonstrate its usage, the quickstart app includes the `DomainAppAppManifestWithFlywayEnabledForSqlServer` manifest.
This adds a number of configuration properties, the most important of which is:

[source,java]
----
configurationProperties.put(
    "isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.schema.autoCreateAll", "false");
----

This tells DataNucleus to _not_ automatically create the required database schema, so that it is instead created "manually" by Flyway running the provided SQL scripts.

There are a number of other configuration properties also set in that manifest; these indicate which schemas FlywayDB should track, and where to locate the migration scripts on the classpath.

The migration scripts themselves are in the `appdefn` module, in a subpackage of `db.migration`:

image::{_imagesdir}modules/flywaydb/migration-scripts.png[width="400px",link="{_imagesdir}modules/flywaydb/migration-scripts.png"]


Before running the app, it may be necessary to manually create the schema for FlywayDB's own `schema_version` table:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE flyway
go
----

With this done, the app can be run against an (otherwise) empty SQL Server database.
This results in FlywayDB automatically creating the database tables:

image::{_imagesdir}modules/flywaydb/mssql-generated-tables.png[width="400px",link="{_imagesdir}modules/flywaydb/mssql-generated-tables.png"]

The `flyway.schema_version` table keeps track of the scripts that have been applied:

image::{_imagesdir}modules/flywaydb/schema_version.png[width="600px",link="{_imagesdir}modules/flywaydb/schema_version.png"]



There are a couple of other points worth making.

* First, the manifest also uses the following configuration property:

+
[source,ini]
----
configurationProperties.put(
    "isis.persistor.datanucleus.impl.datanucleus.Mapping", "sqlserver");
----
+
to instruct DataNucleus to pick up any `-sqlserver.orm` files from the classpath.
There are two such: `DocumentAbstract-sqlserver.orm` and `CommandJdo-sqlserver.orm`.

* Second, the quickstart app also provides a `beforeMigrate.sql` script to drop all index/constraints, and uses the `autoCreateConstraints` property so that DataNucleus will automatically re-create any indices afterwards.

+
For large databases this would not be practicable, in which case the `beforeMigrate.sql` script should be removed.
Any changes to indices would therefore need to be provided in migration SQL scripts.
