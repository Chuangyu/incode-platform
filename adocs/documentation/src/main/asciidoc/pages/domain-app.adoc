== How to run the Demo App

TODO: out of date, this material copied from original READMEs.

The prerequisite software is:

* Java JDK 8
* http://maven.apache.org[maven 3] (3.3.x or later is recommended).

To build the demo app:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/incodehq/isis-module-communications.git
cd isis-module-communications
mvn clean install
----


To run the demo app:

[source]
----
mvn -pl webapp jetty:run
----

Then log on using user: `sven`, password: `pass`




TODO: as per the flywaydb, generate the schema

The app will bootstrap against an in-memory database, however it will be Flyway that sets up the database schema (rather than DataNucleus automatically creating the database as might normally be the case).
This is discussed in a little more detail xref:what-happens-during-bootstrapping[below].

Then log on using user: `sven`, password: `pass`
